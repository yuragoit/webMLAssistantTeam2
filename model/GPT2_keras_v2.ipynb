              "['A deer  or true deer is a hoofed ruminant mammal of the family Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including muntjac, elk (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose. Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this, they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).\\n\\nThe musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related to Cervidae.\\n\\nDeer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a role in mythology, religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the coat of arms of Åland. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.\\n\\nThe word deer was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. Old English dēor and Middle English der meant a wild animal of any kind. Cognates of Old English dēor in other dead Germanic languages have the general sense of animal, such as Old High German tior, Old Norse djur or dȳr, Gothic dius, Old Saxon dier, and Old Frisian diar. This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. All modern Germanic languages save English and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, Dutch/Frisian dier, German Tier, and Norwegian dyr mean animal.\\n\\nFor many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a buck and the female a doe, but the terms vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male red deer is a stag, while for other large species the male is a bull, the female a cow, as in cattle. In older usage, the male of any species is a hart, especially if over five years old, and the female is a hind, especially if three or more years old. The young of small species is a fawn and of large species a calf; a very small young may be a kid. A castrated male is a havier. A group of any species is a herd. The adjective of relation is cervine; like the family name Cervidae, this is from Latin: cervus, meaning stag or deer.\\n\\nDeer live in a variety of biomes, ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. Adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\\n\\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the Barbary stag, a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. Another extinct species of deer, Megaceroides algericus, was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. Fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of brocket deer and pudús of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America\\'s Andes fill the ecological niches of the ibex and wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.\\n\\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn.\\n\\n\\nReindeer herds standing on snow to avoid flies\\nThe Eurasian Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. Many national parks and protected reserves in Europe have populations of red deer, roe deer, and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit Asia Minor, the Caucasus Mountains, and Northwestern Iran. \"European\" fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day Turkey.\\n\\nPresent-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe\\'s deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct tarpan (forest horse), extinct aurochs (forest ox), and the endangered wisent (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the Scottish Highlands, the Austrian Alps, the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and some National Parks, including Doñana National Park in Spain, the Veluwe in the Netherlands, the Ardennes in Belgium, and Białowieża National Park in Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains have forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx, wolves, and brown bears.\\n\\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find Siberian roe deer, sika deer, elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.\\n\\nDeer such as the sika deer, Thorold\\'s deer, Central Asian red deer, and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. Like the Sami people of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.\\n\\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India\\'s Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal\\'s Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to chital, hog deer, barasingha, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which Kanha National Park, Dudhwa National Park, and Chitwan National Park are most famous. Sri Lanka\\'s Wilpattu National Park and Yala National Park have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.\\n\\n\\nA couple Sambar does and a Chital buck roaming the Sigur Plateau in southern India\\nThe Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct Schomburgk\\'s deer, Eld\\'s deer, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld\\'s deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as Khao Yai. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other herbivores, such as Asian elephants, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as nilgai, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, and Indian gazelle in India), and wild oxen (such as wild Asian water buffalo, gaur, banteng, and kouprey). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.\\n\\nAs a result of acclimatisation society releases in the 19th century, Australia has six introduced species of deer that have established sustainable wild populations. They are fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, rusa, and chital. Red deer were introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock. Many have been domesticated in deer farms since the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.\\nDeer are browsers, and feed primarily on foliage of grasses, sedges, forbs, shrubs and trees, secondarily on lichens in northern latitudes during winter.[46] They have small, unspecialized stomachs by ruminant standards, and high nutrition requirements. Rather than eating and digesting vast quantities of low-grade fibrous food as, for example, sheep and cattle do, deer select easily digestible shoots, young leaves, fresh grasses, soft twigs, fruit, fungi, and lichens. The low-fibered food, after minimal fermentation and shredding, passes rapidly through the alimentary canal. The deer require a large amount of minerals such as calcium and phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet. There are some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity, such as eating dead alewives along lakeshores or depredating the nests of northern bobwhites.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle. Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a \"straight truck\" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a \"tractor\".[1]\\n\\nThe majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico. The market-share of electrically powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks.[2] In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles.\\n\\nHistory\\nSteam wagons\\n\\nA Sentinel steam wagon\\nMain article: Steam wagon\\nTrucks and cars have a common ancestor: the steam-powered fardier Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built in 1769.[citation needed] However, steam wagons were not common until the mid-19th century. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these vehicles to very short hauls, usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first semi-trailer appeared in 1881,[citation needed] towed by a steam tractor manufactured by De Dion-Bouton. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of World War I, and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.\\n\\nInternal combustion\\n\\nDaimler Motor-Lastwagen from 1898\\nIn 1895, Karl Benz designed and built the first internal combustion truck. Later that year some of Benz\\'s trucks were modified to become busses by Netphener. A year later, in 1896, another internal combustion engine truck was built by Gottlieb Daimler, the Daimler Motor Lastwagen.[3] Other companies, such as Peugeot, Renault and Büssing, also built their own versions. The first truck in the United States was built by Autocar in 1899 and was available with 5 or 8 horsepower (4 or 6 kW) engines.[4] Trucks of the era mostly used two-cylinder engines and had a carrying capacity of 1.5 to 2 t (3,300 to 4,400 lb). After World War I, several advances were made: electric starters, and 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines.\\n\\nDiesel engines\\nAlthough it had been invented in 1897, the diesel engine did not appear in production trucks until Benz introduced it in 1923.[5] The diesel engine was not common in trucks in Europe until the 1930s. In the United States, Autocar introduced diesel engines for heavy applications in the mid-1930s. Demand was high enough that Autocar launched the \"DC\" model (diesel conventional) in 1939. However, it took much longer for diesel engines to be broadly accepted in the US: gasoline engines were still in use on heavy trucks in the 1970s.[6][7]\\n\\nElectric Motors\\nMain article: Electric truck\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden test driving the Ford F-150 Lightning all-electric pick up at Ford\\'s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center\\nElectrically powered trucks predate internal combustion ones and have been continuously available since the mid-19th-century. In the 1920s Autocar Trucks was the first of the major truck manufacturers to offer a range of electric trucks for sale.[8] Electric trucks were successful for urban delivery roles and as specialized work vehicles like forklifts and pushback tugs. The higher energy density of liquid fuels soon led to the decline of electric-powered trucks in favor of, first, gasoline, and then diesel and CNG-fueled engines until battery technology advanced in the 2000s when new chemistries and higher-volume production broadened the range of applicability of electric propulsion to trucks in many more roles. Today, manufacturers are electrifying all trucks ahead of national regulatory requirements, with long-range over-the-road trucks being the most challenging.[9][10]\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nThis section possibly contains original research.

(February 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\\n\\nMannesmann Mulag truck at the Finlayson factory in Tampere, Finland in 1921\\nTruck is used in American English, and is common in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa, while lorry is the equivalent in British English, and is the usual term in countries like Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore and India.[original research?]\\n\\nThe first known usage of \"truck\" was in 1611 when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships\\' cannon carriages, and comes from \"Trokhos\" (Greek) = \"wheel\". In its extended usage, it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads, a meaning known since 1771. Its expanded application to \"motor-powered load carrier\" has been in usage since 1930, shortened from \"motor truck\", which dates back to 1901.[11][12]\\n\\n\"Lorry\" has a more uncertain origin, but probably has its roots in the rail transport industry, where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a goods wagon as in British usage, not a bogie as in the American), specifically a large flat wagon. It might derive from the verb lurry (to carry or drag along, or to lug) which was in use as early as 1664, but that association is not definitive.[13] The expanded meaning of lorry, \"self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods\", has been in usage since 1911.[14][15]\\n\\nInternational variance\\n\\nA Japanese concrete mixer\\nFurther information: List of truck types\\nIn the United States, Canada, and the Philippines, \"truck\" is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than regular passenger cars, but includes large SUVs, pickups, and other vehicles with an open load bed. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the word \"truck\" is mostly reserved for larger vehicles. In Australia and New Zealand, a pickup truck is frequently called a ute (short for \"utility\" vehicle),[16] while in South Africa it is called a bakkie (Afrikaans: \"small open container\"). In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland, and Hong Kong lorry is used instead of truck, but only for the medium and heavy types, while truck is used almost exclusively to refer to pickups.\\n\\nTypes by size\\nSee also: Truck classification and List of truck types\\nUltra light\\n\\nMight-E Truck from Canadian Electric Vehicles\\nOften produced as variations of golf cars, with internal combustion or battery electric drive, these are used typically for off-highway use on estates, golf courses, and parks. While not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets, generally as a body variation of a neighborhood electric vehicle. A few manufactures produce specialized chassis for this type of vehicle, while Zap Motors markets a version of their Xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the U.S. as a motorcycle).\\n\\nVery light\\n\\nA Piaggio Porter\\n\\nTata Super Ace in Indonesia\\nPopular in Europe and Asia, many mini-trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with monocoque bodies. Specialized designs with substantial frames such as the Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by Daihatsu) and are popular for use in \"old town\" sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.\\n\\nRegardless of name, these small trucks serve a wide range of uses. In Japan, they are regulated under the Kei car laws, which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently, the engine is limited to 660 cc displacement). These vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in Japan. These Japanese-made mini trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road ATVs in the United States, and import regulations require that these mini trucks have a 25 mph (40 km/h) speed governor as they are classified as low-speed vehicles.[17] These vehicles have found uses in construction, large campuses (government, university, and industrial), agriculture, cattle ranches, amusement parks, and replacements for golf carts.[18]\\n\\n\\nSML truck on the road in Accra\\nMajor mini truck manufacturers and their brands:\\n\\nDaihatsu Hijet\\nHonda Acty\\nTata Ace\\nMazda Scrum\\nMitsubishi Minicab\\nSubaru Sambar\\nSuzuki Carry\\nLight\\n\\nA Ford Ranger pickup truck\\nLight trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than 13,900 lb (6.3 t)) and are used by individuals and businesses alike. In the EU they may not weigh more than 3.5 t (7,700 lb) and are allowed to be driven with a driving licence for cars. Pickup trucks, called utes in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nFuso Canter, 8th Generation in Taiwan\\nMedium trucks are larger than light but smaller than heavy trucks. In the US, they are defined as weighing between 13,000 and 33,000 lb (5.9 and 15.0 t). For the UK and the EU the weight is between 3.5 to 7.5 t (7,700 to 16,500 lb). Local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks and fire-fighting trucks) are normally around this size.\\n\\nHeavy\\n\\nA cement mixer is an example of a Class 8 heavy truck.\\n\\nSeddon Atkinson Stratos refuse compactor\\n\\nIn Pakistan the majority of trucks are colorful and decorated.\\nHeavy trucks are the largest on-road trucks, Class 8. These include vocational applications such as heavy dump trucks, concrete pump trucks, and refuse hauling, as well as ubiquitous long-haul 4x2 and 6×4 tractor units.[19]\\n\\nRoad damage and wear increase very rapidly with the axle weight. The number of steering axles and the suspension type also influence the amount of the road wear. In many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight of 44 t (97,000 lb) or more.\\n\\nOff-road\\n\\nALMA antenna transporters are 20 m (65+2⁄3 ft) long, 10 m (32+7⁄9 ft) wide, weigh 130 t (127.9 long tons; 143.3 short tons) and drive on 28 tires.[20]\\nOff-road trucks include standard, extra heavy-duty highway-legal trucks, typically outfitted with off-road features such as a front driving axle and special tires for applications such as logging and construction, and purpose-built off-road vehicles unconstrained by weight limits, such as the Liebherr T 282B mining truck.\\n\\nMaximum sizes by country\\nFurther information: Road train\\nAustralia has complex regulations over weight and length, including axle spacing, type of axle/axle group, rear overhang, kingpin to rear of trailer, drawbar length, ground clearance, as well as height and width laws. These limits are some of the highest in the world, a B-double can weigh 62.5 t (61.5 long tons; 68.9 short tons) and be 25 m (82 ft) long, and road trains used in the outback can weigh 172 t (169.3 long tons; 189.6 short tons) and be 53.5 m (176 ft) long.[21][22]\\n\\nThe European Union also has complex regulations. The number and spacing of axles, steering, single or dual tires, and suspension type all affect maximum weights. Length of a truck, of a trailer, from axle to hitch point, kingpin to rear of trailer, and turning radius are all regulated. In additions, there are special rules for carrying containers, and countries can set their own rules for local traffic.[23]\\n\\nThe United States Federal Bridge Law deals with the relation between the gross weight of the truck, the number of axles, the weight on and the spacing between the axles that the truck can have on the Interstate highway system.[24] Each State determines the maximum permissible vehicle, combination, and axle weight on state and local roads.\\n\\nCountry\\tMaximum\\nwith three axles\\tWith one trailer\\tMaximum combination\\nAustralia[21][22]\\t23 t (22.6 long tons; 25.4 short tons)\\t12 m (39 ft)\\t172 t (169.3 long tons; 189.6 short tons)\\n53.5 m (176 ft)\\nChina[25]\\t25 t (24.6 long tons; 27.6 short tons)\\n12 m (39 ft)\\t49 t (48.2 long tons; 54.0 short tons)\\n16.5 m (54 ft)\\t55 t (54.1 long tons; 60.6 short tons)\\n18.75 m (62 ft)\\nEU[23]\\t26 t (25.6 long tons; 28.7 short tons)\\n12 m (39 ft)\\t16.5 m (54 ft)\\t44 t (43.3 long tons; 48.5 short tons)\\n18.75 m (62 ft)\\nFinland[26]\\t28 t (27.6 long tons; 30.9 short tons)\\n13 m (43 ft)\\t76 t (74.8 long tons; 83.8 short tons)\\n34.5 m (113 ft 2 in)\\t76 t (74.8 long tons; 83.8 short tons)\\n34.5 m (113 ft)\\nIreland[27]\\t26 t (25.6 long tons; 28.7 short tons)\\n12 m (39 ft)\\t30 t (29.5 long tons; 33.1 short tons)\\n16.5 m (54 ft 2 in)\\t44 t (43.3 long tons; 48.5 short tons)\\n22 m (72 ft)\\nSweden[28]\\t26 t (25.6 long tons; 28.7 short tons)\\n24 m (79 ft)\\t74 t (72.8 long tons; 81.6 short tons)\\n25.25 m (82 ft 10 in)\\t74 t (72.8 long tons; 81.6 short tons)\\n25.25 m (82.8 ft)\\nUK[29]\\t26 t (25.6 long tons; 28.7 short tons)\\n12 m (39 ft)\\t44 t (43.3 long tons; 48.5 short tons)\\n16.5 m (54 ft)\\t44 t (43.3 long tons; 48.5 short tons)\\n18.75 m (62 ft)\\nUSA[30][31]\\n(Interstate)\\t54,000 lb (24 t)\\n45 ft (13.7 m)\\t80,000 lb (36 t)\\nnone\\t80,000 lb (36 t)\\nnone\\nUniquely, the State of Michigan has a gross vehicle weight limit of 164,000 lb (74 t), which is twice the U.S. federal limit.[32][33][34] A measure to change the law was defeated in the Michigan Senate in 2019.[35][36][37][38][39]\\n\\nDesign\\nAlmost all trucks share a common construction: they are made of a chassis, a cab, an area for placing cargo or equipment, axles, suspension and roadwheels, an engine and a drivetrain. Pneumatic, hydraulic, water, and electrical systems may also be present. Many also tow one or more trailers or semi-trailers.\\n\\nCab\\n\\nA cabover truck\\n\\nStreamlined conventional cab\\n\\nCab beside engine\\nThe \"cab\", or \"cabin\" is an enclosed space where the driver is seated. A \"sleeper\" is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks.\\n\\nThere are several cab configurations:\\n\\n\"Cab over engine\" (COE) or \"flat nose\"; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the engine. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, and is widely used in the rest of the world. They were common in North American heavy-duty trucks but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium- and light-duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of \"tilt-cab\". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads require the short turning radius afforded by the shorter wheelbase of the cab over engine layout.[40]\\n\"Conventional\" cabs seated the driver behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very streamlined, with a sloped hood (bonnet) and other features to lower drag. Conventional cabs are the most common in North America, Australia, and China, and are known in the UK as \"American cabs\"[citation needed] and in the Netherlands as \"torpedo cabs\".\\n\"Cab beside engine\" designs are used for terminal tractors at shipping yards and for other specialist vehicles carrying long loads such as pipes. This type is often made by replacing the passenger side of a cab-over truck with an extended section of the load bed.\\nA further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.\\n\\nEngines and motors\\n\\nCummins ISB 6.7L medium-duty truck diesel engine\\nMost small trucks such as sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans or pickups, and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use gasoline engines (petrol engines), but many diesel engined models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use four-stroke diesel engines with a turbocharger and intercooler. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a V12 Detroit Diesel two stroke engine. A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ CNG (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions.\\n\\nA significant proportion of North American manufactured trucks use an engine built by the last remaining major independent engine manufacturer (Cummins) but most global OEMs such as Volvo Trucks and Daimler AG promote their own \"captive\" engines.[41]\\n\\nIn the European Union, all new truck engines must comply with Euro VI emission regulations.[42]\\n\\nAs of 2019 several alternative technologies are competing to displace the use of diesel engines in heavy trucks. CNG engines are widely used in the US refuse industry and in concrete mixers, among other short-range vocations, but range limitations have prevented their broader uptake in freight hauling applications. Heavy electric trucks and hydrogen-powered trucks are new to the market in 2021,[43][44] but major freight haulers are interested.[45][46] Although cars will be first the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles includes trucks.[47] According to The Economist magazine \"Electric lorries will probably run on hydrogen, not batteries, which are too expensive.\"[48] Other researchers say that once faster chargers are available batteries will become competitive against diesel for all, except perhaps the heaviest, trucks.[49]\\n\\nDrivetrain\\n\\nA truck rear suspension and drive axles overview\\n\\nEaton Roadranger 18 speed \"crash box\" with automated gearshift\\nSmall trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers). Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as \"crash boxes\", require double-clutching for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as \"floating\", a method of changing gears which doesn\\'t use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double-clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.\\n\\nDouble-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain the required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while the transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while the transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. \"Skip changing\" is also widely used; in principle, the operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.\\n\\nCommon North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18 speeds. Automatic and automated manual transmissions for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12, and 16 gears are common on larger trucks with a manual transmission, while conventional automatic or automated manual transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so‑called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.\\n\\nFrame\\n\\nA truck rear frame (chassis) section view\\n\\nPickup truck frame (right rear view)\\nA truck frame consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C‑shaped rails, or beams, held together by crossmembers. These frames are referred to as ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy-duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.\\n\\nThe frame is usually made of steel, but can be made (whole or in part) of aluminum for a lighter weight. A tow bar may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy tractors almost always make use of a fifth wheel hitch.[citation needed]\\n\\nBody types\\nBox trucks (\"tilts\" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making an enclosed load space. The rear has doors for unloading; a side door is sometimes fitted.[50]\\n\\nChassis cab trucks have a fully enclosed cab at the front, with bare chassis frame-rails behind, suitable for subsequent permanent attachment of a specialized payload, like a fire-truck or ambulance body.\\n\\nConcrete mixers have a rotating drum on an inclined axis, rotating in one direction to mix, and in the other to discharge the concrete down chutes. Because of the weight and power requirements of the drum body and rough construction sites, mixers have to be very heavy duty.[51][52]\\n\\nDump trucks (\"tippers\" in the UK) transport loose material such as sand, gravel, or dirt for construction. A typical dump truck has an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and lifts at the front, allowing the material in the bed to be unloaded (\"dumped\") on the ground behind the truck.[53][54]\\n\\nFlatbed trucks have an entirely flat, level platform body. This allows for quick and easy loading but has no protection for the load. Hanging or removable sides are sometimes fitted.[55]\\n\\nRefrigerator trucks have insulated panels as walls and a roof and floor, used for transporting fresh and frozen cargo such as ice cream, food, vegetables, and prescription drugs. They are mostly equipped with double-wing rear doors, but a side door is sometimes fitted.\\n\\nRefuse trucks have a specialized body for collecting and, often, compacting trash collected from municipal, commercial, and industrial sites. This application has the widest use of the cab-over configuration in North America, to provide better maneuverability in tight situations. They are also among the most severe-duty and highest GVWR trucks on public roads.\\n\\nSemi-tractors (\"artics\" in the UK) have a fifth wheel for towing a semi-trailer instead of a body.\\n\\nTank trucks (\"tankers\" in the UK) are designed to carry liquids or gases. They usually have a cylindrical tank lying horizontally on the chassis. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids and gases that can be transported.[56]\\n\\nWreckers (\"recovery lorries\" in the UK) are used to recover and/or tow disabled vehicles. They are normally equipped with a boom with a cable; wheel/chassis lifts are becoming common on newer trucks.[57][58][59]\\n\\nSales and sales issues\\nManufacturers\\nMain article: List of truck manufacturers\\nTruck market worldwide\\nLargest truck manufacturers in the world as of 2015.\\nPos.\\tMake\\tUnits\\n1\\tDaimler AG (Mercedes-Benz, Freightliner, Unimog, Western Star, Fuso, BharatBenz)\\t506,663[60]\\n2\\tNavistar International\\t359,000[61]\\n3\\tDongfeng\\t336,869[62]\\n4\\tTata\\t317,780[63]\\n5\\tVolvo Group (Volvo, Mack, Renault, UD Nissan)\\t207,475[64]\\n6\\tVolkswagen Group (MAN, Scania, Caminhões e Ônibus)\\t179,035[65]\\n7\\tHino\\t162,870[66]\\n8\\tPaccar (DAF, Kenworth, Peterbilt, Leyland)\\t154,700[67]\\n9\\tIveco\\t140,200[68]\\nDriving\\nIn many countries, driving a truck requires a special driving license.

The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as:\\n\\nCombination\\nHC: Heavy Combination, a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination.\\nMC: Multi Combination, e.g., B Doubles/road trains\\nRigid\\nLR: Light rigid: a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than 4.5 t (4.4 long tons; 5.0 short tons) but not more than 8 t (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons). Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 t (8.9 long tons; 9.9 short tons) GVM.\\nMR: Medium rigid: a rigid vehicle with 2 axles and a GVM of more than 8 t (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons). Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 t (8.9 long tons; 9.9 short tons) GVM. Also includes vehicles in class LR.\\nHR: Heavy Rigid: a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than 8 t (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons). Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 t (8.9 long tons; 9.9 short tons) GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class MR.\\nHeavy vehicle transmission\\nThere is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class HC, HR, or MC test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver\\'s license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box).[69]\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nInside a Mercedes-Benz truck\\nDriving licensing has been harmonized throughout the European Union and the EEA (and practically all European non-member states), so that common rules apply within Europe (see European driving licence). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than 7.5 t (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons) for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats). For licenses first acquired after 1997, that weight was reduced to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons), not including trailers.[citation needed]\\n\\nSince 2013, the C1 license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 and up to 7.5 tonnes. The C license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 tonnes with a trailer up to 750 kg, and the CE category allows driving category C vehicles with a trailer over 750 kg.\\n\\nSouth Africa\\nTo drive any vehicle with a GVM exceeding 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons), a code C1 drivers license is required. Furthermore, if the vehicle exceeds 16 t (15.7 long tons; 17.6 short tons) a code C license becomes necessary.\\n\\nTo drive any vehicle in South Africa towing a trailer with a GVM more than 7.5 t (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons), further restrictions apply and the driver must possess a license suitable for the GVM of the total combination as well as an articulated endorsement. This is indicated with the letter \"E\" prefixing the license code.\\n\\nIn addition, any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing a Public Driver\\'s Permit, (or PrDP) of the applicable type. This is an additional license that is added to the DL card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license.\\n\\nThe requirements for obtaining the different classes are below.\\n\\n\"G\": Required for the transport of general goods, requires a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal.\\n\"P\": Required for the transport of paying passengers, requires a more stringent criminal record check, additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue. A G class PrDP will be issued at the same time.\\n\"D\": Required for the transport of dangerous materials, requires all of the same checks as class P., and in addition the driver must be over 25 at time of issue.\\nUnited States\\n\\nInside a Navistar 9000\\nIn the United States, a commercial driver\\'s license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing 26,001 lb (11,794 kg) or more.[70] The federal government regulates how many hours a driver may be on the clock, how much rest and sleep time is required (e.g., 11 hours driving/14 hours on-duty followed by 10 hours off, with a maximum of 70 hours/8 days or 60 hours/7 days, 34 hours restart )[71] Violations are often subject to significant penalties. Instruments to track each driver\\'s hours must sometimes be fitted. In 2006, the US trucking industry employed 1.8 million drivers of heavy trucks.[72]\\n\\nThere is a shortage of willing trained long-distance truck drivers.[73] Part of the reason for this is the economic fallout from deregulation of the trucking industry. Michael H. Belzer, associate professor, in the economics department at Wayne State University and co-author of Sweatshops on Wheels: Winners and Losers in Trucking Deregulation, argues that low pay, bad working conditions and unsafe conditions have been a direct result of deregulation.[74][75] The book cites poor working conditions and an unfair pay system as responsible for high annual employee turnover in the industry.[76][77]\\n\\nIn 2018, in the US, 5,096 large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes:\\n\\nThe number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes is 4,862,\\nThe number of large trucks involved in injury crashes is 112,000,\\nThe number of large trucks involved in property damage only crashes is 414,000.[78]\\nEnvironmental effects\\nSee also: Diesel exhaust and Environmental effects of transport\\n\\nExhaust fumes from a small truck\\nLike cars, trucks contribute to air, noise, and water pollution.[79] Unlike cars, as of 2022, most trucks run on diesel, and diesel exhaust is especially dangerous for health.[80] Some countries have different vehicle emission standards for trucks and cars.[81][82]\\n\\nNOx and particulates emitted by trucks are very dangerous to health,[83][84] causing thousands of early deaths annually in the US alone.[85] As older trucks are usually the worst,[86] many cities have banned 20th century trucks.[87] Air pollution also threatens professional truck drivers.[88]\\n\\nOver a quarter of global transport CO2 emissions are from road freight,[89] in 2021 over 1700 million tonnes from medium and heavy trucks,[90] so many countries are further restricting truck CO2 emissions to help limit climate change.[91] Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail, especially in Europe.[92] Several countries have pledged that 30% of sales of trucks and buses will be zero emission by 2030.[93]\\n\\nWith respect to noise pollution, trucks emit considerably higher sound levels at all speeds compared to typical cars; this contrast is particularly strong with heavy-duty trucks.[94] There are several aspects of truck operations that contribute to the overall sound that is emitted. Continuous sounds are those from tires rolling on the roadway and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds. Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a turbocharger on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an exhaust brake retarder when traversing a downgrade. There has been noise regulation put in place to help control where and when the use of engine braking retarders are allowed.[citation needed]\\n\\nOperator health and safety\\nAn orange metal housing with an open panel containing three horizontal stacked filters\\nTruck cab filter housing using a contiguous series of pre-, HEPA, and charcoal panel filters\\nA truck cab is a hazard control that protects the truck operator from hazardous airborne pollutants.[citation needed] As an enclosure, it is an example of an engineering control. Enclosed operator cabs have been used on agriculture, mining, and construction vehicles for several decades. Most modern-day enclosed cabs have heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for primarily maintaining a comfortable temperature and providing breathable air for their occupants. Various levels of filtration can be incorporated into the HVAC system to remove airborne pollutants such as dusts, diesel particulate matter (DPM), and other aerosols.[95]\\n\\nTwo key elements of an effective environmental enclosure are a good filtration system and an enclosure with good integrity (sealed isolation from the outside environment). It is recommended that a filtration system filter out at least 95% or greater of airborne respirable aerosols from the intake airflow, with an additional recirculation filtering component for the inside air. Good enclosure integrity is also needed to achieve positive pressure to prevent wind-driven aerosol penetration into the enclosure, as well as to minimize air leakage around the filtration system. Test methods and mathematical modeling of environmental enclosures are also beneficial for quantifying and optimizing filtration system designs, as well as maintaining optimum protection factor performance for enclosure occupants.[95]\\n\\nOperations issues\\nTaxes\\nCommercial trucks in the US pay higher road use taxes on a state level than other road vehicles and are subject to extensive regulation.[96] A few reasons commercial trucks pay higher road use taxes: they are bigger and heavier than most other vehicles, and cause more wear and tear per hour on roadways; and trucks and their drivers are on the road for more hours per day. Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.\\n\\nDamage to pavement\\nThe life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor,[97] which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.[36][37]\\n\\nCommercial insurance\\n\\nThis section does not cite any sources.

This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U.S. state and federal agencies, and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them. Interstate trucks in the U.S. are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance. This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of 10,000 lb (4.5 t) (which transport non-hazardous materials). All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous, and which have a gross weight rating in excess of 10,000 lb (4.5 t) must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance. All motor carriers operating vehicles such as hopper-type cargo vehicles or tankers with a capacity in excess of 3,500 US gal (13,000 L) must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance. Pricing is dependent on region, driving records, and history of the trucking operation.\\n\\nMotor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle. Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled.\\n\\nSafety\\nTrucking accidents\\n\\nTrucking accident\\nIn 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008, the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths, but trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:\\n\\n14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill\\n6.5% cause open flames\\nFollowing increased pressure from The Times \"Cities Fit For Cycling\" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many heavy goods vehicles (HGV). These signs are directed against a common type of accident that occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV\\'s wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the cyclist. The signs, such as the winning design of the InTANDEM road safety competition launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside.\\n\\nHGV safety in the EU\\nIn-vehicle speed limitation is required applying a 90 km/h limit to commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.[98]\\n\\nFront, side, and rear underrun protection is required on commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.[98]\\n\\nTrucks must be fitted with blind-spot mirrors that give drivers a wider field of vision than conventional mirrors.[99]',\n",
              " 'An airplane (American English), or aeroplane (Commonwealth English), informally plane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners[1] and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world\\'s cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.\\n\\nThe Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as \"the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight\".[4] They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders)[5] and the work of German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal, who, between 1867 and 1896, also studied heavier-than-air flight. Lilienthal\\'s flight attempts in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight.[6] Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.\\n\\nEtymology and usage\\nFirst attested in English in the late 19th century (prior to the first sustained powered flight), the word airplane, like aeroplane, derives from the French aéroplane, which comes from the Greek ἀήρ (aēr), \"air\"[7] and either Latin planus, \"level\",[8] or Greek πλάνος (planos), \"wandering\".[9][10] \"Aéroplane\" originally referred just to the wing, as it is a plane moving through the air.[11] In an example of synecdoche, the word for the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft.\\n\\nIn the United States and Canada, the term \"airplane\" is used for powered fixed-wing aircraft. In the United Kingdom and Ireland and most of the Commonwealth, the term \"aeroplane\" (/ˈɛərəpleɪn/[11]) is usually applied to these aircraft.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: Aviation history and First flying machine\\n\\nLe Bris and his glider, Albatros II, photographed by Nadar, 1868\\n\\nOtto Lilienthal in mid-flight, c. 1895\\nAntecedents\\nMany stories from antiquity involve flight, such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus, and the Vimana in ancient Indian epics. Around 400 BC in Greece, Archytas was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam, said to have flown some 200 m (660 ft).[12][13] This machine may have been suspended for its flight.[14][15]\\n\\nSome of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the 9th-century Andalusian and Arabic-language poet Abbas ibn Firnas and the 11th-century English monk Eilmer of Malmesbury; both experiments injured their pilots.[16] Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a man-powered aircraft in his Codex on the Flight of Birds (1502), noting for the first time the distinction between the center of mass and the center of pressure of flying birds.\\n\\nIn 1799, George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.[17][18] Cayley was building and flying models of fixed-wing aircraft as early as 1803, and he built a successful passenger-carrying glider in 1853.[5] In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first powered flight, by having his glider \"L\\'Albatros artificiel\" pulled by a horse on a beach.[19] Then the Russian Alexander F. Mozhaisky also made some innovative designs. In 1883, the American John J. Montgomery made a controlled flight in a glider.[20] Other aviators who made similar flights at that time were Otto Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher, and Octave Chanute.\\n\\nSir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34 m) wingspan that was powered by two 360-horsepower (270 kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off. The craft was uncontrollable and it is presumed that Maxim realized this because he subsequently abandoned work on it.[21]\\n\\nIn the 1890s, Lawrence Hargrave conducted research on wing structures and developed a box kite that lifted the weight of a man. His box kite designs were widely adopted. Although he also developed a type of rotary aircraft engine, he did not create and fly a powered fixed-wing aircraft.[22]\\n\\nBetween 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights. Lilienthal\\'s work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing,[23][24] his flight attempts in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight,[25] the \"Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat\" is considered to be the first airplane in series production and his work heavily inspired the Wright brothers.[26]\\n\\nEarly powered flights\\n\\nPatent drawings of Clement Ader\\'s Éole.\\nThe Frenchman Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying machines in 1886, the Éole. It was a bat-like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with four cylinders developing 20 horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed no more than 4 kilograms per kilowatt (6.6 lb/hp). The wings had a span of 14 m (46 ft). All-up weight was 300 kilograms (660 lb). On 9 October 1890, Ader attempted to fly the Éole. Aviation historians give credit to this effort as a powered take-off and uncontrolled hop of approximately 50 m (160 ft) at a height of approximately 200 mm (7.9 in).[27][28] Ader\\'s two subsequent machines were not documented to have achieved flight.[29]\\n\\nThe American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as \"the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight\".[4] By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully controllable, stable flight for substantial periods. The Wright brothers credited Otto Lilienthal as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight.\\n\\n\\nSantos-Dumont 14-bis, between 1906 and 1907\\nIn 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made what was claimed to be the first airplane flight unassisted by catapult[30] and set the first world record recognized by the Aéro-Club de France by flying 220 meters (720 ft) in less than 22 seconds.[31] This flight was also certified by the FAI.[32][33]\\n\\nAn early aircraft design that brought together the modern monoplane tractor configuration was the Blériot VIII design of 1908. It had movable tail surfaces controlling both yaw and pitch, a form of roll control supplied either by wing warping or by ailerons and controlled by its pilot with a joystick and rudder bar. It was an important predecessor of his later Blériot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of the summer of 1909.[34]\\n\\nWorld War I served as a testbed for the use of the airplane as a weapon. Airplanes demonstrated their potential as mobile observation platforms, then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing casualties to the enemy. The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronized machine gun-armed fighter aircraft occurred in 1915, by German Luftstreitkräfte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens. Fighter aces appeared; the greatest (by number of Aerial Combat victories) was Manfred von Richthofen.\\n\\nFollowing WWI, aircraft technology continued to develop. Alcock and Brown crossed the Atlantic non-stop for the first time in 1919. The first international commercial flights took place between the United States and Canada in 1919.[35]\\n\\nAirplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. They were an essential component of the military strategies of the period, such as the German Blitzkrieg, The Battle of Britain, and the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific War.\\n\\nDevelopment of jet aircraft\\n\\nThe Concorde supersonic transport aircraft\\nThe first practical jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178, which was tested in 1939. In 1943, the Messerschmitt Me 262, the first operational jet fighter aircraft, went into service in the German Luftwaffe.\\n\\nThe first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to 2010. The Boeing 747 was the world\\'s biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it was surpassed by the Airbus A380 in 2005.\\n\\nSupersonic airliner flights, including those of the Concorde, have been limited to over-water flight at supersonic speed because of their sonic boom, which is prohibited over most populated land areas. The high cost of operation per passenger-mile and a deadly crash in 2000 induced the operators of the Concorde to remove it from service.[36][37]\\n\\nPropulsion\\nSee also: Powered aircraft and Aircraft engine\\nPropeller\\nMain articles: Propeller (aeronautics) and Aircraft engine\\n\\nAn Antonov An-2 biplane\\nAn aircraft propeller, or airscrew, converts rotary motion from an engine or other power source, into a swirling slipstream which pushes the propeller forwards or backwards. It comprises a rotating power-driven hub, to which are attached two or more radial airfoil-section blades such that the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis.[38] Three types of aviation engines used to power propellers include reciprocating engines (or piston engines), gas turbines, and electric motors. The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined, in part, by its disk area—the area through which the blades rotate. The limitation on blade speed is the speed of sound; as when the blade tip exceeds the speed of sound, shock waves decrease propeller efficiency. The rpm required to generate a given tip speed is inversely proportional to the diameter of the propeller. The upper design speed limit for propeller-driven aircraft is Mach 0.6. Aircraft designed to go faster than that employ jet engines.[39]\\n\\nReciprocating engine\\nMain articles: Radial engine, Inline engine (aeronautics), and Flat engine\\nReciprocating engines in aircraft have three main variants, radial, in-line and flat or horizontally opposed engine. The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders \"radiate\" outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel and was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines became predominant. An inline engine is a reciprocating engine with banks of cylinders, one behind another, rather than rows of cylinders, with each bank having any number of cylinders, but rarely more than six, and may be water-cooled. A flat engine is an internal combustion engine with horizontally-opposed cylinders.\\n\\nGas turbine\\nMain article: Turboprop\\nA turboprop gas turbine engine consists of an intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a propelling nozzle, which provide power from a shaft through a reduction gearing to the propeller. The propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop.\\n\\nElectric motor\\n\\nSolar Impulse 1, a solar-powered aircraft with electric motors.\\nMain article: Electric motor\\nAn electric aircraft runs on electric motors with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming,[40] or batteries. Currently, flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental prototypes, including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, but there are some production models on the market.[41]\\n\\nJet\\nMain article: Jet engine\\nJet aircraft are propelled by jet engines, which are used because the aerodynamic limitations of propellers do not apply to jet propulsion. These engines are much more powerful than a reciprocating engine for a given size or weight and are comparatively quiet and work well at higher altitude. Variants of the jet engine include the ramjet and the scramjet, which rely on high airspeed and intake geometry to compress the combustion air, prior to the introduction and ignition of fuel. Rocket motors provide thrust by burning a fuel with an oxidizer and expelling gas through a nozzle.\\n\\nTurbofan\\nMost jet aircraft use turbofan jet engines, which employ a gas turbine to drive a ducted fan, which accelerates air around the turbine to provide thrust in addition to that which is accelerated through the turbine. The ratio of air passing around the turbine to that passing through is called the by-pass ratio.[42] They represent a compromise between turbojet (with no bypass) and turboprop forms of aircraft propulsion (primarily powered with bypass air).[43]\\n\\nSubsonic aircraft, such as airliners, employ high by-pass jet engines for fuel efficiency. Supersonic aircraft, such as jet fighters, use low-bypass turbofans. However at supersonic speeds, the air entering the engine must be decelerated to a subsonic speed and then re-accelerated back to supersonic speeds after combustion. An afterburner may be used on combat aircraft to increase power for short periods of time by injecting fuel directly into the hot exhaust gases. Many jet aircraft also use thrust reversers to slow down after landing.[43]\\n\\nRamjet\\nMain article: Ramjet\\n\\nArtist\\'s concept of X-43A with scramjet attached to the underside\\nA ramjet is a form of jet engine that contains no major moving parts and can be particularly useful in applications requiring a small and simple engine for high-speed use, such as with missiles. Ramjets require forward motion before they can generate thrust and so are often used in conjunction with other forms of propulsion, or with an external means of achieving sufficient speed. The Lockheed D-21 was a Mach 3+ ramjet-powered reconnaissance drone that was launched from a parent aircraft. A ramjet uses the vehicle\\'s forward motion to force air through the engine without resorting to turbines or vanes. Fuel is added and ignited, which heats and expands the air to provide thrust.[44]\\n\\nScramjet\\nMain article: Scramjet\\nA scramjet is a specialized ramjet that uses internal supersonic airflow to compress, combine with fuel, combust and accelerate the exhaust to provide thrust. The engine operates at supersonic speeds only. The NASA X-43, an experimental unmanned scramjet, set a world speed record in 2004 for a jet-powered aircraft with a speed of Mach 9.7, nearly 12,100 kilometers per hour (7,500 mph).[45]\\n\\nRocket\\nMain article: Rocket engine\\n\\nBell X-1 in flight, 1947\\nWhereas jet aircraft use the atmosphere both as a source of oxidant and of mass to accelerate reactively behind the aircraft, rocket aircraft carry the oxidizer on board and accelerate the burned fuel and oxidizer backwards as the sole source of mass for reaction. Liquid fuel and oxidizer may be pumped into a combustion chamber or a solid fuel with oxidizer may burn in the fuel chamber. Whether liquid or solid-fueled, the hot gas is accelerated through a nozzle.[46]\\n\\nIn World War II, the Germans deployed the Me 163 Komet rocket-powered aircraft. The first plane to break the sound barrier in level flight was a rocket plane – the Bell X-1 in 1948. The North American X-15 broke many speed and altitude records in the 1960s and pioneered engineering concepts for later aircraft and spacecraft. Military transport aircraft may employ rocket-assisted take offs for short-field situations. Otherwise, rocket aircraft include spaceplanes, like SpaceShipTwo, for travel beyond the Earth\\'s atmosphere and sport aircraft developed for the short-lived Rocket Racing League.\\n\\nDesign and manufacture\\nMain article: Aerospace manufacturer\\nSR-71 at Lockheed Skunk Works\\nAssembly line of the SR-71 Blackbird at Skunk Works, Lockheed Martin\\'s Advanced Development Programs (ADP).\\nMost airplanes are constructed by companies with the objective of producing them in quantity for customers. The design and planning process, including safety tests, can last up to four years for small turboprops or longer for larger planes.\\n\\nDuring this process, the objectives and design specifications of the aircraft are established. First the construction company uses drawings and equations, simulations, wind tunnel tests and experience to predict the behavior of the aircraft. Computers are used by companies to draw, plan and do initial simulations of the aircraft. Small models and mockups of all or certain parts of the plane are then tested in wind tunnels to verify its aerodynamics.\\n\\nWhen the design has passed through these processes, the company constructs a limited number of prototypes for testing on the ground. Representatives from an aviation governing agency often make a first flight. The flight tests continue until the aircraft has fulfilled all the requirements. Then, the governing public agency of aviation of the country authorizes the company to begin production.\\n\\nIn the United States, this agency is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the European Union, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); in the United Kingdom it is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).[47] In Canada, the public agency in charge and authorizing the mass production of aircraft is Transport Canada\\'s Civil Aviation Authority.[48]\\n\\nWhen a part or component needs to be joined together by welding for virtually any aerospace or defense application, it must meet the most stringent and specific safety regulations and standards. Nadcap, or the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program sets global requirements for quality, quality management and quality assurance for aerospace engineering.[49]\\n\\nIn the case of international sales, a license from the public agency of aviation or transport of the country where the aircraft is to be used is also necessary. For example, airplanes made by the European company, Airbus, need to be certified by the FAA to be flown in the United States, and airplanes made by U.S.-based Boeing need to be approved by the EASA to be flown in the European Union.[50]\\n\\n\\nAn Airbus A321 on final assembly line 3 in the Airbus Hamburg-Finkenwerder plant.\\nRegulations have resulted in reduced noise from aircraft engines in response to increased noise pollution from growth in air traffic over urban areas near airports.[51]\\n\\nSmall planes can be designed and constructed by amateurs as homebuilts. Other homebuilt aircraft can be assembled using pre-manufactured kits of parts that can be assembled into a basic plane and must then be completed by the builder.[52]\\n\\nFew companies produce planes on a large scale. However, the production of a plane for one company is a process that actually involves dozens, or even hundreds, of other companies and plants, that produce the parts that go into the plane. For example, one company can be responsible for the production of the landing gear, while another one is responsible for the radar. The production of such parts is not limited to the same city or country; in the case of large plane manufacturing companies, such parts can come from all over the world.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe parts are sent to the main plant of the plane company, where the production line is located. In the case of large planes, production lines dedicated to the assembly of certain parts of the plane can exist, especially the wings and the fuselage.[citation needed]\\n\\nWhen complete, a plane is rigorously inspected to search for imperfections and defects. After approval by inspectors, the plane is put through a series of flight tests to assure that all systems are working correctly and that the plane handles properly. Upon passing these tests, the plane is ready to receive the \"final touchups\" (internal configuration, painting, etc.), and is then ready for the customer.[citation needed]\\n\\nCharacteristics\\n\\nMajor components of an airplane.\\n\\nAn IAI Heron - an unmanned aerial vehicle with a twin-boom configuration\\nAirframe\\nMain article: Airframe\\nThe structural parts of a fixed-wing aircraft are called the airframe. The parts present can vary according to the aircraft\\'s type and purpose. Early types were usually made of wood with fabric wing surfaces, When engines became available for powered flight around a hundred years ago, their mounts were made of metal. Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal until by the end of WWII all-metal aircraft were common. In modern times, increasing use of composite materials has been made.\\n\\nTypical structural parts include:\\n\\nOne or more large horizontal wings, often with an airfoil cross-section shape. The wing deflects air downward as the aircraft moves forward, generating lifting force to support it in flight. The wing also provides stability in roll to stop the aircraft from rolling to the left or right in steady flight.\\n\\nThe An-225 Mriya, which could carry a 250-tonne payload, had two vertical stabilizers.\\nA fuselage, a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically smooth. The fuselage joins the other parts of the airframe and usually contains important things such as the pilot, payload and flight systems.\\nA vertical stabilizer or fin is a vertical wing-like surface mounted at the rear of the plane and typically protruding above it. The fin stabilizes the plane\\'s yaw (turn left or right) and mounts the rudder, which controls its rotation along that axis.\\nA horizontal stabilizer or tailplane, usually mounted at the tail near the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilize the plane\\'s pitch (tilt up or down) and mounts the elevators, which provide pitch control.\\nLanding gear, a set of wheels, skids, or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface. On seaplanes, the bottom of the fuselage or floats (pontoons) support it while on the water. On some planes the landing gear retracts during flight to reduce drag.\\nWings\\nMain article: Wing\\nThe wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, air flows over the wings, which are shaped to create lift. This shape is called an airfoil and is shaped like a bird\\'s wing.\\n\\nWing structure\\nAirplanes have flexible wing surfaces which are stretched across a frame and made rigid by the lift forces exerted by the airflow over them. Larger aircraft have rigid wing surfaces which provide additional strength.\\n\\nWhether flexible or rigid, most wings have a strong frame to give them their shape and to transfer lift from the wing surface to the rest of the aircraft. The main structural elements are one or more spars running from root to tip, and many ribs running from the leading (front) to the trailing (rear) edge.\\n\\nEarly airplane engines had little power, and lightness was very important. Also, early airfoil sections were very thin, and could not have a strong frame installed within. So, until the 1930s, most wings were too lightweight to have enough strength, and external bracing struts and wires were added. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 30s, wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not needed any more. This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing.\\n\\nWing configuration\\nMain article: Wing configuration\\n\\nCaptured Morane-Saulnier L wire-braced parasol monoplane\\nThe number and shape of the wings varies widely on different types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central fuselage into port (left) and starboard (right) wings. Occasionally, even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged quadruplane and other multiplane designs have had little success.\\n\\nA monoplane has a single wing plane, a biplane has two stacked one above the other, a tandem wing has two placed one behind the other. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 30s and bracing was no longer needed, the unbraced or cantilever monoplane became the most common form of powered type.\\n\\nThe wing planform is the shape when seen from above. To be aerodynamically efficient, a wing should be straight with a long span from side to side but have a short chord (high aspect ratio). But to be structurally efficient, and hence light weight, a wing must have a short span but still enough area to provide lift (low aspect ratio).\\n\\nAt transonic speeds (near the speed of sound), it helps to sweep the wing backwards or forwards to reduce drag from supersonic shock waves as they begin to form. The swept wing is just a straight wing swept backwards or forwards.\\n\\n\\nTwo Dassault Mirage G prototypes, one with wings swept\\nThe delta wing is a triangle shape that may be used for several reasons. As a flexible Rogallo wing, it allows a stable shape under aerodynamic forces and so is often used for ultralight aircraft and even kites. As a supersonic wing, it combines high strength with low drag and so is often used for fast jets.\\n\\nA variable geometry wing can be changed in flight to a different shape. The variable-sweep wing transforms between an efficient straight configuration for takeoff and landing, to a low-drag swept configuration for high-speed flight. Other forms of variable planform have been flown, but none have gone beyond the research stage.\\n\\nFuselage\\nMain article: Fuselage\\nA fuselage is a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically smooth. The fuselage may contain the flight crew, passengers, cargo or payload, fuel and engines. The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a cockpit located at the front or top of the fuselage and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments. A plane may have more than one fuselage, or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes.\\n\\nWings vs. bodies\\nFlying wing\\nMain article: Flying wing\\n\\nThe US-produced B-2 Spirit is a strategic bomber. It has a flying wing configuration and is capable of intercontinental missions\\nA flying wing is a tailless aircraft which has no definite fuselage. Most of the crew, payload and equipment are housed inside the main wing structure.[53]\\n\\nThe flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the 1930s and 1940s, notably by Jack Northrop and Cheston L. Eshelman in the United States, and Alexander Lippisch and the Horten brothers in Germany. After the war, several experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept, but the known difficulties remained intractable. Some general interest continued until the early 1950s but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented several technical problems, leading to the adoption of \"conventional\" solutions like the Convair B-36 and the B-52 Stratofortress. Due to the practical need for a deep wing, the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow-to-medium speed range, and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical airlifter design.\\n\\nInterest in flying wings was renewed in the 1980s due to their potentially low radar reflection cross-sections. Stealth technology relies on shapes which only reflect radar waves in certain directions, thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft - a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves. This approach eventually led to the Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. In this case, the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary needs. However, modern computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems allowed for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized, making for an efficient and stable long-range bomber.\\n\\nBlended wing body\\nMain article: Blended wing\\n\\nComputer-generated model of the Boeing X-48\\nBlended wing body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body, which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft, and distinct and separate wing structures, though the wings are smoothly blended in with the body.\\n\\nThus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design. The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high-lift wings and a wide airfoil-shaped body. This enables the entire craft to contribute to lift generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy.\\n\\nLifting body\\n\\nThe Martin Aircraft Company X-24 was built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental US military program.\\nMain article: Lifting body\\nA lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces lift. In contrast to a flying wing, which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage, a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing. Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces, lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight, or, spacecraft re-entry. All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability. Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 70s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft. The US built several famous lifting body rocket planes to test the concept, as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific. Interest waned as the US Air Force lost interest in the manned mission, and major development ended during the Space Shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage.\\n\\nEmpennage and foreplane\\nMain articles: Empennage and Canard (aeronautics)\\n\\nCanards on the Saab Viggen\\nThe classic airfoil section wing is unstable in flight and difficult to control. Flexible-wing types often rely on an anchor line or the weight of a pilot hanging beneath to maintain the correct attitude. Some free-flying types use an adapted airfoil that is stable, or other ingenious mechanisms including, most recently, electronic artificial stability.\\n\\nTo achieve stability and control, most fixed-wing types have an empennage comprising a fin and rudder which act horizontally and a tailplane and elevator which act vertically. These control surfaces can typically be trimmed to relieve control forces for various stages of flight. This is so common that it is known as the conventional layout. Sometimes there may be two or more fins, spaced out along the tailplane.\\n\\nSome types have a horizontal \"canard\" foreplane ahead of the main wing, instead of behind it.[54][55][56] This foreplane may contribute to the lift, the trim, or control of the aircraft, or to several of these.\\n\\nControls and instruments\\nMain article: Aircraft flight control system\\n\\nA light aircraft (Robin DR400/500) cockpit\\nFurther information: Fixed-wing aircraft § Aircraft controls, and Fixed-wing aircraft § Cockpit instrumentation\\nAirplanes have complex flight control systems. The main controls allow the pilot to direct the aircraft in the air by controlling the attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) and engine thrust.\\n\\nOn manned aircraft, cockpit instruments provide information to the pilots, including flight data, engine output, navigation, communications and other aircraft systems that may be installed.\\n\\nSafety\\nMain article: Aviation safety\\nWhen risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer, air travel is approximately 10 times safer than travel by bus or rail. However, when using the deaths per journey statistic, air travel is significantly more dangerous than car, rail, or bus travel.[57] Air travel insurance is relatively expensive for this reason—insurers generally use the deaths per journey statistic.[58] There is a significant difference between the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes, with the per-mile statistic indicating that airliners are 8.3 times safer than smaller planes.[59]\\n\\nEnvironmental impact\\nMain article: Environmental impact of aviation\\n\\nWater vapor contrails left by high-altitude jet airliners. These may contribute to cirrus cloud formation.\\nLike all activities involving combustion, fossil-fuel-powered aircraft release soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to airplanes: for instance,\\n\\nAirplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause (mainly large jet airliners) emit aerosols and leave contrails, both of which can increase cirrus cloud formation – cloud cover may have increased by up to 0.2% since the birth of aviation.[60]\\nAirplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes, particularly nitrogen compounds, which interact with ozone, increasing ozone concentrations.[61][62]\\nMost light piston aircraft burn avgas, which contains tetraethyllead (TEL). Some lower-compression piston engines can operate on unleaded mogas and turbine engines and diesel engines – neither of which require lead – are used on some newer light aircraft. Some non-polluting light electric aircraft are already in production.\\nAnother environmental impact of airplanes is noise pollution, mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing.',\n",
              " 'A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2]\\n\\nFrench inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.\\n\\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[7] such as Project Drawdown\\'s 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[8]\\n\\nThere are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[9] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[11] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People\\'s ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12]\\n\\nThere are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.[13]\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum \"wheeled vehicle\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \"two-wheeled cart\", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \"chariot\".[14][15] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[16][17]\\n\\n\"Motor car\", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English.[2] \"Autocar\", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \"self-propelled car\", is now considered archaic.[18] \"Horseless carriage\" is attested from 1895.[19]\\n\\n\"Automobile\", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) \"self\" and Latin mobilis \"movable\", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[20] It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America,[21] where the abbreviated form \"auto\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \"auto industry\" and \"auto mechanic\".[22][23]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of the automobile\\n\\nThis section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience.

It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[11][24][25] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest\\'s model was successfully built or run.[25]\\n\\n\\nCugnot\\'s 1771 fardier à vapeur, as preserved at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris, France\\nNicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[26] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[26] His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[26] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\\n\\nThe development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\n\\nIn 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world\\'s first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[27] Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\", and used it to develop the world\\'s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces\\' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[27] Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir,[28] who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[29]\\n\\n\\nGustave Trouvé\\'s tricycle, the first electric automobile to be demonstrated in public\\n\\nCarl Benz, the inventor of the modern car\\nIn November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity.[30] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.[29][31][32]\\n\\n\\nThe original Benz Patent-Motorwagen, first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept\\nIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband\\'s invention.\\n\\n\\nBertha Benz, the first long distance driver\\nIn 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.\\n\\nDaimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895, about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\\'s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\n\\n\\nÉmile Levassor\\n\\nArmand Peugeot\\nIn 1890, Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300 mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris–Brest–Paris bicycle race, but finished six days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\n\\nThe first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. Patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\n\\nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[33][34] Studebaker, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897[35]:\\u200a66\\u200a and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904.[36]\\n\\nIn Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[37] Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first gasoline-powered car in the country in 1894,[38] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs.[38] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson\\'s company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.[38]\\n\\nIn 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Engine\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine.[29] Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for a few decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda\\'s version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\n\\nAll in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.[39]\\n\\nMass production\\nSee also: Automotive industry\\n\\nRansom E. Olds founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company (Oldsmobile) in 1897.\\n\\nHenry Ford founded Ford Motor Company in 1903.\\n\\n1927 Ford Model T\\n\\nKiichiro Toyoda, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation 1941–1950\\n\\nFord Motor Company automobile assembly line in the 1920s\\n\\nThe Toyota Corolla is the best-selling car of all-time.\\nLarge-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan, and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[40] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world\\'s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\n\\nAs a result, Ford\\'s cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5 manhours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[41] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford\\'s apocryphal remark, \"any color as long as it\\'s black\".[41] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\\' pay.[41]\\n\\nFord\\'s complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury.[42] The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\n\\nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroën was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[41]\\n\\nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world\\'s attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\n\\nSince the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\\n\\nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared bonnet, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[41]\\n\\nIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford\\'s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41 per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroën did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault\\'s 10CV and Peugeot\\'s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[41] Germany\\'s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Rüsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5 per cent of the market.[41]\\n\\nIn Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda\\'s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\n\\nFuel and propulsion technologies\\nSee also: Alternative fuel vehicle\\n\\n2011 Nissan Leaf electric car\\n\\nLow battery and motors can improve safety[43]\\nThe transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.[44]\\n\\nMost cars in use in the early 2020s run on gasoline burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulfur gasoline, gasoline-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution.[45][46] Some cities ban older gasoline-fuelled cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of gasoline-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.[47][48]\\n\\nOther hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, autogas, and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies,[49][50] concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021, nine per cent were electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 16 million electric cars on the world\\'s roads.[51] Despite rapid growth, less than two per cent of cars on the world\\'s roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021.[51] Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\n\\nOil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.\\n\\nAs of 2023 few production cars use wheel hub motors.[52][53]\\n\\nBatteries\\nMain article: Electric vehicle battery\\nSee also: Electric car § Batteries, and Automotive battery\\nIn almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot.[54] Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes[55]) for emergency stops, regenerative braking improves efficiency, particularly in city driving.[56]\\n\\nUser interface\\nMain article: Car controls\\n\\nIn the Ford Model T the left-side hand lever sets the rear wheel parking brakes and puts the transmission in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on the left of the steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake.\\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car\\'s speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars\\' controls are now standardized, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\n\\nSome of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However, new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW\\'s iDrive and Ford\\'s MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars\\' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\n\\nElectronics and interior\\n\\nPanel for fuses and circuit breakers\\nCars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[57][58][a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.[59][60]\\n\\nDedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.\\n\\nLighting\\nMain article: Automotive lighting\\n\\nAudi A4 daytime running lights\\nCars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-colored reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\n\\nWeight\\n\\nA Chevrolet Suburban extended-length SUV weighs 3,300 kilograms (7,200 lb) (gross weight).[61]\\nDuring the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries,[62] modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \"more-powerful—if more efficient—engines\"[63] and, as of 2019, typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons).[64] Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[63] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500 lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban.\\n\\nSome places tax heavier cars more: as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel.[65] It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidizing charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.[66]\\n\\nSeating and body style\\nSee also: Car body style, Car classification, Truck classification, and Vehicle size class\\nMost cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.\\n\\nSafety\\nMain articles: Car safety, Traffic collision, Low speed vehicle, and Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions\\n\\nResult of a serious car collision\\nTraffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland,[67] and Henry Bliss one of the US\\'s first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[68] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the Euro and US NCAP tests,[69] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[70]\\n\\nCosts and benefits\\nMain articles: Economics of car usage, Car costs, and Effects of the car on societies\\n\\nRoad congestion is an issue in many major cities (pictured is Chang\\'an Avenue in Beijing).[71]\\nThe costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,[9] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits—perceived and real—of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience,[11] and emergency power.[72] During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\"[73]\\n\\nSimilarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, noise pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12]\\n\\nEnvironmental effects\\nSee also: Exhaust gas, Waste tires, Environmental effects of transport, Motor vehicle emissions and pregnancy, Noise pollution, Environmental aspects of the electric car, Vehicle recycling, and Externalities of automobiles\\nclose-up of 2 exhaust pipes with whitish smoke\\nThis exhaust gas is not the only car pollution\\nCars are a major cause of urban air pollution,[74] with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres, and road wear,[75] although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards.[76] While there are different ways to power cars most rely on gasoline or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019.[47] Both gasoline and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars.[77] Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021.[78] As of 2021, due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometers before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars;[79][80] however this varies considerably[81] and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity, and longer lasting batteries[82] produced in larger factories.[83] Many governments use fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars;[84] and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones.[85] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g., hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars,[citation needed] or to not drive.[85]\\n\\nThe lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 million km (1.2 million miles) if driven a lot.[86] According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019, far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date, the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030.[87] The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy.[47] Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030.[88] Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars,[89] and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.[90]\\n\\nThe manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[91] Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of gasoline.[92] The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car, resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[93]\\n\\nAnimals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car, the \"loss of habitat potential\" may be over 50,000 square metres (540,000 sq ft) based on primary production correlations.[94][clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.\\n\\nGrowth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion.[95] Moscow, Istanbul, Bogotá, Mexico City and São Paulo were the world\\'s most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company.[96]\\n\\nSocial issues\\nMass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia, Argentina, and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the United States, the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods,[97] with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income.[98] The historic commitment to a car-based transport system continued during the presidency of Joe Biden. Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying, financing and insuring them.[99]\\n\\nEmerging car technologies\\nAlthough intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s,[100] other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging,[101] hydrogen cars,[102] and hydrogen/electric hybrids.[103] Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.[104]\\n\\nNew materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium,[105] fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes.[106] Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[107]\\n\\nAutonomous car\\nMain article: Autonomous car\\n\\nA robotic Volkswagen Passat shown at Stanford University is a driverless car.\\nFully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist as robotaxis[108][109] but have a long way to go before they are in general use.[110]\\n\\nOpen source development\\nMain article: Open source car\\nThere have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as a whole including both hardware and software, and no mass production ready open-source based designs have been introduced. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.[111]\\n\\nCar sharing\\nCar-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[112] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to \"share\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.[113]\\n\\nIndustry\\nMain article: Automotive industry\\n[icon]\\t\\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2019)\\n\\nA car being assembled in a factory\\nThe automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world\\'s motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020, there were 56 million cars manufactured worldwide,[114] down from 67 million the previous year.[115]\\n\\nThe automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20 million in 2020), followed by Japan (seven million), then Germany, South Korea and India.[116] The largest market is China, followed by the US.\\n\\nAround the world, there are about a billion cars on the road;[117] they burn over a trillion litres (0.26×1012 US gal; 0.22×1012 imp gal) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 exajoules (14,000 TWh) of energy.[118] The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India.[13] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[119][120] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.\\n\\nAlternatives\\nMain article: Alternatives to car use\\n\\nThe Vélib\\' in Paris, France, is the largest bikesharing system outside China.\\nEstablished alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses, trolleybusses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been developed in large US cities.[121][122] Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[123]',\n",
              " 'Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or \"perching\" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.\\n\\nBirds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Early to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.[5]\\n\\nMany social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.\\n\\nMany species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.\\n\\nEvolution and classification\\nMain article: Evolution of birds\\nSlab of stone with fossil bones and feather impressions\\nArchaeopteryx lithographica is often considered the oldest known true bird.\\nThe first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.[7] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use.[8] Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda.[9]\\n\\nDefinition\\nAves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[10] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[11] in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.[citation needed]\\n\\nGauthier and de Queiroz[12] identified four different definitions for the same biological name \"Aves\", which is a problem. The authors proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. He assigned other names to the other groups.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\n Reptiles\\t\\n  Archosaurs  \\t\\n  Crocodiles\\n\\n  Birds\\n\\n  Turtles\\n\\n  Squamates  \\t\\n  Lizards and snakes\\n\\nThe birds\\' phylogenetic relationships to major living reptile groups\\nAves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternately Avemetatarsalia)\\nAves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately Avifilopluma)\\nAves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae)\\nAves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a \"crown group\", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes)\\nUnder the fourth definition Archaeopteryx, traditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. These proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term \"bird\" by these researchers.[13]\\n\\nManiraptoromorpha\\t\\n†Coelurus\\n\\n†Ornitholestes\\n\\nManiraptoriformes\\t\\n†Ornithomimosauria\\n\\nManiraptora\\t\\n†Alvarezsauridae\\n\\nPennaraptora\\t\\n†Oviraptorosauria\\n\\nParaves\\n\\nCladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic study by Cau, 2018.[14]\\nMost researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a definition similar to \"all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus\",[15][16] with Troodon being sometimes added as a second external specifier in case it is closer to birds than to Deinonychus.[17] Avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics). Jacques Gauthier, who named Avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them.[12][18]\\n\\nDespite being currently one of the most widely used, the crown-group definition of Aves has been criticised by some researchers. Lee and Spencer (1997) argued that, contrary to what Gauthier defended, this definition would not increase the stability of the clade and the exact content of Aves will always be uncertain because any defined clade (either crown or not) will have few synapomorphies distinguishing it from its closest relatives. Their alternative definition is synonymous to Avifilopluma.[19]\\n\\nDinosaurs and the origin of birds\\nMain article: Origin of birds\\nParaves\\t\\n†Scansoriopterygidae\\n\\n†Eosinopteryx\\n\\nEumaniraptora\\t\\n†Jinfengopteryx\\n\\n†Aurornis\\n\\n†Dromaeosauridae\\n\\n†Troodontidae\\n\\nAvialae\\n\\nCladogram following the results of a phylogenetic study by Cau et al., 2015[20]\\n\\nSimplified phylogenetic tree showing the relationship between modern birds and dinosaurs[21]\\nBased on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs[22] and, more specifically, members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs, among others.[23] As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. By the 2000s, discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrated many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contributed to this ambiguity.[24][25][26]\\n\\n\\nAnchiornis huxleyi is an important source of information on the early evolution of birds in the Late Jurassic period.[27]\\nThe consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids.[28] Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of Deinonychosauria, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, have been able to glide, or both.[29][30] Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.[31]\\n\\nThe Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics—teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail—as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.[32]\\n\\nEarly evolution\\nSee also: List of fossil bird genera\\nWhite slab of rock left with cracks and impression of bird feathers and bone, including long paired tail feathers\\nConfuciusornis sanctus, a Cretaceous bird from China that lived 125 million years ago, is the oldest known bird to have a beak.[33]\\nOver 40% of key traits found in modern birds evolved during the 60 million year transition from the earliest bird-line archosaurs to the first maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs closer to living birds than to Tyrannosaurus rex. The loss of osteoderms otherwise common in archosaurs and acquisition of primitive feathers might have occurred early during this phase.[14][34] After the appearance of Maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 million years marked a continuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic (juvenile-like) characteristics. Hypercarnivory became increasingly less common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs became longer.[14] The integument evolved into complex, pennaceous feathers.[34]\\n\\nThe oldest known paravian (and probably the earliest avialan) fossils come from the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, and Aurornis xui.[13]\\n\\nThe well-known probable early avialan, Archaeopteryx, dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from Germany. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or \"hind wings\" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.[35]\\n\\nAvialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous period. Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves).[36] Increasingly stiff tails (especially the outermost half) can be seen in the evolution of maniraptoromorphs, and this process culminated in the appearance of the pygostyle, an ossification of fused tail vertebrae.[14] In the late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pelvis, allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size.[37] Around 95 million years ago, they evolved a better sense of smell.[38]\\n\\nA third stage of bird evolution starting with Ornithothoraces (the \"bird-chested\" avialans) can be associated with the refining of aerodynamics and flight capabilities, and the loss or co-ossification of several skeletal features. Particularly significant are the development of an enlarged, keeled sternum and the alula, and the loss of grasping hands.

Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period, enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the Mesozoic era.[36]\\n\\nMany species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the Euornithes (meaning \"true birds\", because they include the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the Enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, waders, and swimming and diving species.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe latter included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis[40] and the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.[36] The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).[41] Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers,[42] which may have replaced the \"hind wing\" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.[35]\\n\\nA study on mosaic evolution in the avian skull found that the last common ancestor of all Neornithes might have had a beak similar to that of the modern hook-billed vanga and a skull similar to that of the Eurasian golden oriole. As both species are small aerial and canopy foraging omnivores, a similar ecological niche was inferred for this hypothetical ancestor.[43]\\n\\nDiversification of modern birds\\nSee also: Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds and dinosaur classification\\nAves\\t\\nPalaeognathae\\t\\n(ratites and tinamous)\\n\\nNeognathae\\t\\n Galloanserae \\t\\n(landfowl and waterfowl)\\n\\nNeoaves\\t\\n(all other birds including perching birds)\\n\\nMajor groups of modern birds based on Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy\\nMost studies agree on a Cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the Early Cretaceous[3][44] to the latest Cretaceous.[45][4] Similarly, there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred in the Cretaceous and associated withe breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana or occurred later and potentially as a consequence of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[46] This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous evolutionary radiation, while fossil evidence points to a Cenozoic radiation (the so-called \\'rocks\\' versus \\'clocks\\' controversy).\\n\\nThe discovery of Vegavis from the Maastrichtian, the last stage of the Late Cretaceous proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic era.[47] The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago,[48] are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification. In 2020, Asteriornis from the Maastrichtian was described, it appears to be a close relative of Galloanserae, the earliest diverging lineage within Neognathae.[1]\\n\\nAttempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence using genomic-scale DNA data and comprehensive fossil information have not resolved the controversy.[45][49] However, a 2015 estimate that used a new method for calibrating molecular clocks confirmed that while modern birds originated early in the Late Cretaceous, likely in Western Gondwana, a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[50] Modern birds would have expanded from West Gondwana through two routes. One route was an Antarctic interchange in the Paleogene. The other route was probably via Paleocene land bridges between South American and North America, which allowed for the rapid expansion and diversification of Neornithes into the Holarctic and Paleotropics.[50] On the other hand, the occurrence of Asteriornis in the Northern Hemisphere suggest that Neornithes dispersed out of East Gondwana before the Paleocene.[1]\\n\\nClassification of bird orders\\nSee also: List of birds\\nAll modern birds lie within the crown group Aves (alternately Neornithes), which has two subdivisions: the Palaeognathae, which includes the flightless ratites (such as the ostriches) and the weak-flying tinamous, and the extremely diverse Neognathae, containing all other birds.[51] These two subdivisions have variously been given the rank of superorder,[52] cohort,[9] or infraclass.[53] Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint, the number of known living bird species is around 10,906[54][55] although other sources may differ in their precise number.\\n\\nCladogram of modern bird relationships based on Braun & Kimball (2021)[56]\\n\\nAves\\t\\nPalaeognathae\\t\\nStruthioniformes (ostriches) Struthio camelus -

Sibley and Ahlquist\\'s Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the subject.[58] Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate,[59] but scientists disagree about the relationships among the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. Fossil and molecular evidence from the 2010s providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.[45][49]\\n\\nGenomics\\nSee also: list of sequenced animal genomes\\nAs of 2010, the genome had been sequenced for only two birds, the chicken and the zebra finch. As of 2022 the genomes of 542 species of birds had been completed. At least one genome has been sequenced from every order.[60][61] These include at least one species in about 90% of extant avian families (218 out of 236 families recognised by the Howard and Moore Checklist).[62]\\n\\nBeing able to sequence and compare whole genomes gives researchers many types of information, about genes, the DNA that regulates the genes, and their evolutionary history. This has led to reconsideration of some of the classifications that were based solely on the identification of protein-coding genes. Waterbirds such as pelicans and flamingos, for example, may have in common specific adaptations suited to their environment that were developed independently.[60][61]\\n\\nDistribution\\nSee also: Lists of birds by region and List of birds by population\\nsmall bird withpale belly and breast and patterned wing and head stands on concrete\\nThe range of the house sparrow has expanded dramatically due to human activities.[63]\\nBirds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel\\'s breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica.[64] The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics; however studies from the 2000s found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.[65] Many species migrate annually over great distances and across oceans; several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world\\'s oceans and in them, and some seabird species come ashore only to breed,[66] while some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft) deep.[67]\\n\\nMany bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird.[68] Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity.[69] Some species, including cattle egret,[70] yellow-headed caracara[71] and galah,[72] have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural expansion created alternative habitats although modern practices of intensive agriculture have negatively impacted farmland bird populations.[73]\\n\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nMain articles: Bird anatomy and Bird vision\\nSee also: Egg tooth\\n\\nExternal anatomy of a bird (example: yellow-wattled lapwing): 1 Beak, 2 Head, 3 Iris, 4 Pupil, 5 Mantle, 6 Lesser coverts, 7 Scapulars, 8 Median coverts, 9 Tertials, 10 Rump, 11 Primaries, 12 Vent, 13 Thigh, 14 Tibio-tarsal articulation, 15 Tarsus, 16 Foot, 17 Tibia, 18 Belly, 19 Flanks, 20 Breast, 21 Throat, 22 Wattle, 23 Eyestripe\\nCompared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight.\\n\\nSkeletal system\\nMain article: Bird_anatomy § Skeletal_system\\nThe skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system.[74] The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.[75] The orbital cavities that house the eyeballs are large and separated from each other by a bony septum (partition). The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.[76] The last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum.[75] The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings.[77] The wings are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups that lost their wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.[78]\\n\\nExcretory system\\nLike the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid, instead of urea or ammonia, through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste.[79][80][81] However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia.[82] They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals.[75] This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird\\'s cloaca.[83][84] The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets.[85]\\n\\nIt is a common but not universal feature of altricial passerine nestlings (born helpless, under constant parental care) that instead of excreting directly into the nest, they produce a fecal sac. This is a mucus-covered pouch that allows parents to either dispose of the waste outside the nest or to recycle the waste through their own digestive system.[86]\\n\\nReproductive system\\nMales within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves.[87][88] The length is thought to be related to sperm competition.[89] For male birds to get an erection, they depend on lymphatic fluid instead of blood.[90] When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. Female birds have sperm storage tubules[91] that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.[92] Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. Most female birds have a single ovary and a single oviduct, both on the left side,[93] but there are exceptions: species in at least 16 different orders of birds have two ovaries. Even these species, however, tend to have a single oviduct.[93] It has been speculated that this might be an adaptation to flight, but males have two testes, and it is also observed that the gonads in both sexes decrease dramatically in size outside the breeding season.[94][95] Also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal. A more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there would be a risk to survival.[93] While rare, mostly abortive, parthenogenesis is not unknown in birds and eggs can be diploid, automictic and results in male offspring.[96]\\n\\nBirds are solely gonochoric.[97] Meaning they have two sexes: either female or male. The sex of birds is determined by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).[75] A complex system of disassortative mating with two morphs is involved in the white-throated sparrow Zonotrichia albicollis, where white- and tan-browed morphs of opposite sex pair, making it appear as if four sexes were involved since any individual is compatible with only a fourth of the population.[98]\\n\\nIn nearly all species of birds, an individual\\'s sex is determined at fertilisation. However, one 2007 study claimed to demonstrate temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio.[99] This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.[100]\\n\\nRespiratory and circulatory systems\\nBirds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.[75] Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird\\'s lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.[101] Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea;[102] the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird\\'s size.[103]\\n\\nIn birds, the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta.[75] The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.[104]\\n\\nHeart type and features\\n\\nDidactic model of an avian heart\\nThe avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication.[105] The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart\\'s pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.[106]\\n\\nThe sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.[105] The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.[107]\\n\\nOrganisation\\nBirds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.[107] The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular contractions, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.[108] As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.[citation needed]\\n\\nCapillaries are organised into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart.[108] Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.[citation needed]\\n\\nNervous system\\nThe nervous system is large relative to the bird\\'s size.[75] The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell[109] with notable exceptions including kiwis,[110] New World vultures[111] and tubenoses.[112] The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water.[75] Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.[113] They also have double cones, likely to mediate achromatic vision.[114]\\n\\n\\nThe nictitating membrane as it covers the eye of a masked lapwing\\nMany birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers.[115] Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents.[116] With the exception of pigeons and a few other species,[117] the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.[118] The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds.[75] The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.[75]\\n\\nEyes of most birds are large, not very round and capable of only limited movement in the orbits,[75] typically 10–20°.[119] Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.[119][120] The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.[121]\\n\\nDefence and intraspecific combat\\nA few species are able to use chemical defences against predators; some Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor,[122] and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers.[123]\\n\\nA lack of field observations limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death.[124] The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents.[124] The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.[124]\\n\\nFeathers, plumage, and scales\\nMain articles: Feather, Flight feather, and Down feather\\nOwl with eyes closed in front of similarly coloured tree trunk partly obscured by green leaves\\nThe disruptively patterned plumage of the African scops owl allows it to blend in with its surroundings.\\nFeathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling.[75] There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status,[125] and sex.[126]\\n\\nPlumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey–Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey–Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages.[127] Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.[128]\\n\\nA small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.[129] As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.[128] Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae.[130] The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail.[128][131] The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward.[132] Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.[133]\\n\\nRed parrot with yellow bill and wing feathers in bill\\nRed lory preening\\nFeathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.[134] The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers\\' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria.[135] This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.[136]\\n\\nThe scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers. The scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.[137]\\n\\nFlight\\nMain articles: Bird flight and Flightless birds\\nBlack bird with white chest in flight with wings facing down and tail fanned and down pointing\\nRestless flycatcher in the downstroke of flapping flight\\nMost birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.[75]\\n\\nWing shape and size generally determine a bird\\'s flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds.[138] Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, most likely due to limited resources and the absence of mammalian land predators.[139] Flightlessness is almost exclusively correlated with gigantism due to an island\\'s inherent condition of isolation.[140] Although flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \"fly\" through the water, as do some flight-capable birds such as auks, shearwaters and dippers.[141]\\n\\nBehaviour\\nMost birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.[142]\\n\\nDiet and feeding\\nIllustration of the heads of 16 types of birds with different shapes and sizes of beak\\nFeeding adaptations in beaks\\nBirds\\' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and various small animals, including other birds.[75] The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.[143] Some species such as pigeons and some psittacine species do not have a gallbladder.[144] Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.[145] Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein stored in many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.[146]\\n\\nBirds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.[75] Avian foraging strategies can vary widely by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial \\'biological control agents\\' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.[147] Combined, insectivorous birds eat 400–500 million metric tons of arthropods annually.[148]\\n\\nNectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers.[149] Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds\\' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches.[75][150] Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion,[66] while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders.[151][152] Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.[153][154]\\n\\nSome species, including frigatebirds, gulls,[155] and skuas,[156] engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species\\' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%.[157] Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.[158]\\n\\nWater and drinking\\nWater is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands.[159] Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting.[160] Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.[161]\\n\\nMost birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.[162] Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers.[163] Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.[164]\\n\\nFeather care\\nMain article: Preening\\nFeathers, being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and bird lice.[165] The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.[166][167]\\n\\nMigration\\nMain article: Bird migration\\n\\nA flock of Canada geese in V formation\\nMany bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long-distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.[168][169]\\n\\nMigration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi),[75] although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).[170] Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi).[171] Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.[172]\\n\\nA map of the Pacific Ocean with several coloured lines representing bird routes running from New Zealand to Korea\\nThe routes of satellite-tagged bar-tailed godwits migrating north from New Zealand. This species has the longest known non-stop migration of any species, up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).\\nSome bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability.[173] Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates.[174] Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory.[175]\\n\\nAltitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food.[176] Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.[177]\\n\\nThe ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a Manx shearwater released in Boston in the United States returned to its colony in Skomer, in Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi).[178] Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.[75] Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris.[179] These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth\\'s geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.[180]\\n\\nCommunication\\nSee also: Bird vocalisation\\n\\nBird song\\n0:39\\nSong of the house wren, a common North American songbird\\nMimicry\\n0:23\\nA tooth-billed bowerbird mimicking a spangled drongo\\nDrumming\\n0:03\\nA woodpecker drumming on wood\\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\\nBirds communicate primarily using visual and auditory signals. Signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).\\n\\nBirds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance,[181] to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern\\'s mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks.[182]\\n\\nLarge brown patterned ground bird with outstretched wings each with a large spot in the centre\\nThe startling display of the sunbittern mimics a large predator.\\nVisual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.[75] The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \"dances\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements;[183] males\\' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.[184]\\n\\nBird calls and songs, which are produced in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.[102] Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction,[75] evaluation of potential mates,[185] bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories,[75] the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season),[186] and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat.[187] Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers,[188] woodpeckers drum for long-distance communication,[189] and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.[190]\\n\\nFlocking and other associations\\nmassive flock of tiny birds seen from distance so that birds appear as specks\\nRed-billed queleas, the most numerous species of wild bird,[191] form enormous flocks – sometimes tens of thousands strong.\\nWhile some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency.[75] Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.[192] Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.[193]\\n\\nBirds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface.[194] Some species of hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.[195]\\n\\nResting and roosting\\n\"Roosting\" redirects here. For other uses, see Roost.\\nPink flamingo with grey legs and long neck pressed against body and head tucked under wings\\nMany birds, like this American flamingo, tuck their head into their back when sleeping.\\nThe high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening \"peeks\", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats.[196] Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.[197] It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.[198]\\n\\nSome birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals.[199] Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.[200] Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.[201] Unusual mobile roost sites include large herbivores on the African savanna that are used by oxpeckers.[202]\\n\\nMany sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon-locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down.[203] Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates.[204] This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.[205] Birds do not have sweat glands, but can lose water directly through the skin, and they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.[206][207]\\n\\nBreeding\\nSee also: Category:Avian sexuality, Animal sexual behaviour § Birds, Seabird breeding behaviour, and Sexual selection in birds\\nSocial systems\\nBird faces up with green face, black breast and pink lower body. Elaborate long feathers on the wings and tail.\\nLike others of its family, the male Raggiana bird-of-paradise has elaborate breeding plumage used to impress females.[208]\\nNinety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate.[209] Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which care from both the female and the male parent is required in order to successfully rear a brood.[210] Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common.[211] Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.[212]\\n\\nFor females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.[213] Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.[214]\\n\\nOther mating systems, including polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur.[75] Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males.[75] Mating systems vary across bird families[215] but variations within species are thought to be driven by environmental conditions.[216]\\n\\nBreeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.[217] Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate. Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection,[218] although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females.[219] Courtship feeding, billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.[220]\\n\\nHomosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.[221] Over 130 avian species around the world engage in sexual interactions between the same sex or homosexual behaviours. \"Same-sex courtship activities may involve elaborate displays, synchronized dances, gift-giving ceremonies, or behaviors at specific display areas including bowers, arenas, or leks.\"[222]\\n\\nTerritories, nesting and incubation\\nSee also: Bird nest\\nMany birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.[223]\\n\\nAll birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.[75] Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite\\'s egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.[224]\\n\\nYellow weaver (bird) with black head hangs an upside-down nest woven out of grass fronds.\\nMale golden-backed weavers construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass.\\nBird eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows.[225] Some bird nests can be a simple scrape, with minimal or no lining; most seabird and wader nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival,[226] and feathers are often used for nest insulation.[225] Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in open habitat ground-nesting species where any addition of nest material would make the nest more conspicuous. Many ground nesting birds lay a clutch of eggs that hatch synchronously, with precocial chicks led away from the nests (nidifugous) by their parents soon after hatching.[227]\\n\\nNest made of straw with five white eggs and one grey speckled egg\\nNest of an eastern phoebe that has been parasitised by a brown-headed cowbird\\nIncubation, which regulates temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.[75] In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation.[228] The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.[229] Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).[75]\\n\\nThe diversity of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species. Several avian characteristics are compared in the table below.[230][231]\\n\\nSpecies\\tAdult weight\\n(grams)\\tIncubation\\n(days)\\tClutches\\n(per year)\\tClutch size\\nRuby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris)\\t3\\t13\\t2.0\\t2\\nHouse sparrow (Passer domesticus)\\t25\\t11\\t4.5\\t5\\nGreater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus)\\t376\\t20\\t1.5\\t4\\nTurkey vulture (Cathartes aura)\\t2,200\\t39\\t1.0\\t2\\nLaysan albatross (Diomedea immutabilis)\\t3,150\\t64\\t1.0\\t1\\nMagellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus)\\t4,000\\t40\\t1.0\\t1\\nGolden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)\\t4,800\\t40\\t1.0\\t2\\nWild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)\\t6,050\\t28\\t1.0\\t11\\nParental care and fledging\\nMain article: Parental care in birds\\nAt the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed altricial, and tend to be born small, blind, immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial. Altricial chicks need help thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an \"altricial-precocial spectrum\".[232] Chicks at neither extreme but favouring one or the other may be termed semi-precocial[233] or semi-altricial.[234]\\n\\nLooking down on three helpless blind chicks in a nest within the hollow of a dead tree trunk\\nAltricial chicks of a white-breasted woodswallow\\nThe length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.[235] At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.[236] The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.[237]\\n\\nHummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks\\nA female calliope hummingbird feeding fully grown chicks\\nIn some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.[238] Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens,[239] but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.[75] Although territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.[240]\\n\\nThe point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.[241] Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.[242] Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.[243]\\n\\nBrood parasites\\nMain article: Brood parasite\\nSmall brown bird places an insect in the bill of much larger grey bird in nest\\nReed warbler raising a common cuckoo, a brood parasite\\nBrood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual\\'s brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.[244] After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird\\'s nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host\\'s own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.[245] One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.[244] Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host\\'s young, which allows them to destroy the host\\'s eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host\\'s chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.[246]\\n\\nSexual selection\\n\\nThe peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a Fisherian runaway\\nMain article: Sexual selection in birds\\nBirds have evolved a variety of mating behaviours, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway. Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations.[247] Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual\\'s fitness. Conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage colouration and courtship behaviour are \"honest\" traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours.[248]\\n\\nInbreeding depression\\nMain article: Inbreeding depression\\nInbreeding causes early death (inbreeding depression) in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata.[249] Embryo survival (that is, hatching success of fertile eggs) was significantly lower for sib-sib mating pairs than for unrelated pairs.[citation needed]\\n\\nDarwin\\'s finch Geospiza scandens experiences inbreeding depression (reduced survival of offspring) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.[250]\\n\\nInbreeding avoidance\\nMain article: Inbreeding avoidance\\nIncestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs).[251] Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see Promiscuity#Other animals for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding. However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings. Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.[251]\\n\\nInbreeding depression occurs in the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.[252]\\n\\nSouthern pied babblers Turdoides bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates.[253]\\n\\nCooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.[254] Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups. In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.[255] Cross-fertilisation between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.[256][257]\\n\\nEcology\\n\\nGran Canaria blue chaffinch, an example of a bird highly specialised in its habitat, in this case in the Canarian pine forests\\nBirds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.[191] While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, or nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Many grassland birds are granivores. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Birds are also preyed upon by a range of mammals including a few avivorous bats.[258] A wide range of endo- and ectoparasites depend on birds and some parasites that are transmitted from parent to young have co-evolved and show host-specificity.[259]\\n\\nSome nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.[260] Plants and pollinating birds often coevolve,[261] and in some cases a flower\\'s primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.[262]\\n\\nBirds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand nine species of moa were important browsers, as are the kererū and kokako today.[260] Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.[263]\\n\\nMany birds act as ecosystem engineers through the construction of nests, which provide important microhabitats and food for hundreds of species of invertebrates.[264][265] Nesting seabirds may affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil[266] and the surrounding seas.[267]\\n\\nA wide variety of avian ecology field methods, including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology.[268]\\n\\nRelationship with humans\\nMain article: Human uses of birds\\nTwo rows of cages in a dark barn with many white chickens in each cage\\nIndustrial farming of chickens\\nSince birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man.[269] Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana.[270] Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow[271] have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests,[272] and some pose an aviation hazard.[273] Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills[274] and predation by pet cats and dogs are common causes of death for birds).[275]\\n\\nBirds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.[276]\\n\\nEconomic importance\\nSee also: Pet § Birds\\nIllustration of fisherman on raft with pole for punting and numerous black birds on raft\\nThe use of cormorants by Asian fishermen is in steep decline but survives in some areas as a tourist attraction.\\nDomesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called poultry, are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide.[277] Chickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common.[278] Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock.[citation needed] Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand.[279] Although some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.[280]\\n\\nOther commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.[281]\\n\\nBirds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species.[282] Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism,[283]\\n\\nAmateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) number in the millions.[284] Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. Bird feeding has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an estimated 75% of households in Britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter.[285]\\n\\nIn religion and mythology\\nWoodcut of three long-legged and long-necked birds\\nThe 3 of Birds by the Master of the Playing Cards, 15th-century Germany\\nBirds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology. In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs[286] or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilisations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" (from which the word \"auspicious\" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.[287]\\n\\nThey may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יונה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.[288] Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the people of southern India.[289] In the ancient world, doves were used as symbols of the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna (later known as Ishtar),[290][291] the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah,[290][291][292] and the Greek goddess Aphrodite.[290][291][293][294][295] In ancient Greece, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of Athens, had a little owl as her symbol.[296][297][298] In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.[299] Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.[299]\\n\\nIn culture and folklore\\n\\nPainted tiles with design of birds from Qajar dynasty\\nBirds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early cave painting[300] and carvings.[301] Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori\\'s legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.[302] Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors.[303] With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.[citation needed]\\n\\nAmong the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society.[304] Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2.[305] The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\'s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a \\'burden\\'.[306] Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.[307] Aircraft, particularly military aircraft, are frequently named after birds. The predatory nature of raptors make them popular choices for fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Harrier Jump Jet, while the names of seabirds may be chosen for aircraft primarily used by naval forces such as the HU-16 Albatross and the V-22 Osprey.[308]\\n\\n\\nThe flag of Dominica prominently features the Sisserou Parrot, its national bird.\\nPerceptions of bird species vary across cultures. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa,[309] but are regarded as wise across much of Europe.[310] Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.[311] In heraldry, birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms[312] In vexillology, birds are a popular choice on flags. Birds feature in the flag designs of 17 countries and numerous subnational entities and territories.[313] Birds are used by nations to symbolize a country\\'s identity and heritage, with 91 countries officially recognizing a national bird. Birds of prey are highly represented, though some nations have chosen other species of birds with parrots being popular among smaller, tropical nations.[314]\\n\\nIn music\\nMain article: Birds in music\\nIn music, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi, Messiaen, and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as Ottorino Respighi first did; or like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg, they can duet with birds.[315][316][317][318]\\n\\nConservation\\nMain article: Bird conservation\\nSee also: Late Quaternary prehistoric birds, List of extinct birds, and Raptor conservation\\nLarge black bird with featherless head and hooked bill\\nThe California condor once numbered only 22 birds, but conservation measures have raised that to over 500 today.\\nAlthough human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times,[319] although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands.[320] Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009.[321][322]\\n\\nThe most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss.[323] Other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles, long-line fishing bycatch,[324] pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use),[325] competition and predation from nonnative invasive species,[326] and climate change.\\n\\nGovernments and conservation groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.[327]',\n",
              " 'The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill small rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]\\n\\nThe cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]\\n\\nFemale domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]\\n\\nIt was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13]\\n\\nAs of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned[16][17] and around 42 million households owning at least one cat.[18] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[19]\\n\\nEtymology and naming\\nThe origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[20] It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, \\'tomcat\\', or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[21] The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic[22] or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska \\'wildcat\\' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[23] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ\\u200e qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.\\n\\nHowever, it is \"equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic\".[24] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, \\'female stoat\\', and Hungarian hölgy, \\'lady, female stoat\\'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, \\'female (of a furred animal)\\'.[25]\\n\\nThe English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[26][27]\\n\\nA male cat is called a tom or tomcat[28] (or a gib,[29] if neutered). A female is called a queen[30] (or a molly,[31][user-generated source?] if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[32] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.[33]\\n\\nTaxonomy\\nThe scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[34][35]\\n\\nIn 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus.[36][37] In 2007, it was considered a subspecies, F. silvestris catus, of the European wildcat (F. silvestris) following results of phylogenetic research.[38][39] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.[40]\\n\\nEvolution\\nMain article: Cat evolution\\n\\nSkulls of a wildcat (top left), a housecat (top right), and a hybrid between the two. (bottom center)\\nThe domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago.[41] The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[42] Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[43] The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[44] and roughly 20,000 genes.[45] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[46]\\n\\nDomestication\\nSee also: Domestication of the cat\\n\\nA cat eating a fish under a chair, a mural in an Egyptian tomb dating to the 15th century BC\\nThe earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[47] Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[13][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.[48]\\n\\nThe earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe.[49] During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium.[50] By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.[51] By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.[48]\\n\\nDuring domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated.[52] House cats often mate with feral cats.[53] Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.[54][55]\\n\\nDevelopment of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.[56] An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds.[57] Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.[58]\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nMain article: Cat anatomy\\nSize\\n\\nDiagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat\\nThe domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[59] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[60] Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).[43]\\n\\nSkeleton\\nCats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[61]:\\u200a11\\u200a The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat\\'s spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[61]:\\u200a16\\u200a Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.[62]\\n\\nSkull\\n\\nCat skull\\n\\nA cat with exposed teeth and claws\\nThe cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[63]:\\u200a35\\u200a Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey\\'s vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.[64] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.[64]\\n\\nThe premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats\\' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.[63]:\\u200a37\\u200a Cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.[65]\\n\\nClaws\\n\\nShed claw sheaths\\nCats have protractible and retractable claws.[66] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw\\'s toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet.[67] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.[68]\\n\\nMost cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (\"polydactyly\").[69] Polydactylous cats occur along North America\\'s northeast coast and in Great Britain.[70]\\n\\nAmbulation\\nThe cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.[71] Unlike most mammals, it uses a \"pacing\" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a \"diagonal\" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.[72]\\n\\nBalance\\n13:37\\nComparison of cat righting reflexes in gravity and zero gravity\\nMost breeds of cat are notably fond of sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.[73]\\n\\nDuring a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex.[74] A cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more.[75] How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the \"falling cat problem\".[76]\\n\\nCoats\\nMain article: Cat coat genetics\\nThe cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offsprings. The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow for the variety of color in coats. The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons.[77] Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene and were used to perform linkage analysis in a pedigree of 89 domestic cats that segregated for melanism.[78]\\n\\nSenses\\nMain article: Cat senses\\nVision\\n\\nReflection of camera flash from the tapetum lucidum\\nA tabby cat with a third, translucent eyelid covering part of either eye\\nA cat\\'s nictitating membrane shown as it blinks\\nCats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.[63]:\\u200a43\\u200a This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye\\'s sensitivity to dim light.[79] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration.[80] At low light, a cat\\'s pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.[81] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited.[82] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.[83] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.\\n\\nHearing\\nThe domestic cat\\'s hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[84] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.[85][86] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.[87][88] Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners\\' locations based on hearing owners\\' voices.[89]\\n\\nSmell\\nCats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area, which is about twice that of humans.[90] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson\\'s organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,[91] which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands.[92] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion.[93] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.[94] This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats\\' social or sexual behaviors.[95]\\n\\nTaste\\nCats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).[96] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.[97] Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.[98] Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the \"prey\" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).[96]\\n\\nWhiskers\\n\\nThe whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.\\nTo aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.[63]:\\u200a47\\u200a\\n\\nBehavior\\nSee also: Cat behavior\\nOutdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.[99] Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).[100] The timing of cats\\' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active in the morning and evening. However, house cats\\' behaviour is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners\\' sleeping patterns to some extent.[101][102]\\n\\nCats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term \"cat nap\" for a short rest refers to the cat\\'s tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.[103]\\n\\nSociability\\nThe social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females.[104] Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others.[105] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females\\' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.[92] Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.[106]\\n\\nLife in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, a cat\\'s human keeper functions as if a mother surrogate.[107] Adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore.[108] Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.[109]\\n\\nRedirected aggression is a common form of aggression which can occur in multiple cat households. In redirected aggression there is usually something that agitates the cat: this could be a sight, sound, or another source of stimuli which causes a heightened level of anxiety or arousal. If the cat cannot attack the stimuli, it may direct anger elsewhere by attacking or directing aggression to the nearest cat, dog, human or other being.[110][111]\\n\\nDomestic cats\\' scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding.[112]\\n\\nCommunication\\nMain article: Cat communication\\n\\nVocalizing domestic cat\\nDomestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[7] Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat\\'s position in the group\\'s social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones.[113] Feral cats are generally silent.[114]:\\u200a208\\u200a Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.[104]\\n\\nPurring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal.[115] Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed,[116][117] or eating. Even though purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual.[115] Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill or in apparent pain.[118]\\n\\nThe exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefully. The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis are thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30-40 milliseconds (giving a frequency of 33 to 25 Hz).[115][119][120]\\n\\nGrooming\\n\\nThe hooked papillae on a cat\\'s tongue act like a hairbrush to help clean and detangle fur\\nCats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.[121] The cat\\'s tongue has backward-facing spines about 500 μm long, which are called papillae. These contain keratin which makes them rigid[122] so the papillae act like a hairbrush. Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.[121]\\n\\nFighting\\n\\nA domestic cat\\'s arched back, raised fur, and open-mouthed hiss are signs of aggression.\\nAmong domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.[123] Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male.[124] Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.[123] Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.[125]\\n\\nWhen cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.[126] Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. Cats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponents. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent\\'s belly with their powerful hind legs.[127]\\n\\nSerious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. Fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus.[128] Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.[129] Cats are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and foxes.[130]\\n\\nHunting and feeding\\nSee also: Cat food\\n\\nA domestic cat with its prey, a deermouse\\nThe shape and structure of cats\\' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction. Therefore, when drinking they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouths. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward.[131][132]\\n\\nFeral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day. The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. They select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past.[106][133] It is also a common misconception that cats like milk/cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea.[134] Some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.[135]\\n\\nCats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents,[136] and are often used as a form of pest control.[137][138] Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured.[139] The strategy used depends on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.[140]:\\u200a153\\u200a Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.[141]\\n\\nCertain species appear more susceptible than others; in one English village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic cat.[142] In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis) in Britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation.[143] In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety.[144]\\n\\nPerhaps the best-known element of cats\\' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to \"play\" with prey by releasing and recapturing it. This cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.[145]\\n\\nAnother poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. One explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top.[146] Another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding \"an elderly cat, or an inept kitten\".[147] This hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, despite males having negligible involvement in raising kittens.[140]:\\u200a153\\u200a\\n\\nPlay\\nMain article: Cat play and toys\\nPlay fight between kittens aged 14 weeks\\nDomestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey.[148] Cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.[149]\\n\\nCats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.[150] Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. They become habituated to a toy they have played with before.[151] String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat\\'s tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death.[152] Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer\\'s dot, which cats may chase.[153]\\n\\nReproduction\\nSee also: Kitten\\n\\nWhen cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female\\'s neck as she assumes a position conducive to mating known as lordosis behavior.\\nFemale cats, called queens, are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. They are usually ready to mate between early February and August.[154]\\n\\nSeveral males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat\\'s penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm (1⁄32 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation.[155]\\n\\n\\nRadiography of a pregnant cat. The skeletons of two fetuses are visible on the left and right of the uterus.\\nAfter mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.[156] Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.[157] Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.[156]\\n\\nThe morula forms 124 hours after conception. At 148 hours, early blastocysts form. At 10–12 days, implantation occurs.[158] The gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.[154][159]\\n\\n\\nA newborn kitten\\nData on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between May 1998 and October 2000. They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.[9] The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed.[156] Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.[154]\\n\\nCats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother.[160] They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction.[161] This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months.[162] In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered.[163]\\n\\nLifespan and health\\nMain articles: Cat health and Aging in cats\\nThe average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s, it was about seven years,[164]:\\u200a33\\u200a[165] rising to 9.4 years in 1995[164]:\\u200a33\\u200a and about 15 years in 2021.[citation needed] Some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s,[166] with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.[167]\\n\\nNeutering increases life expectancy: one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.[164]:\\u200a35\\u200a Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.[168]\\n\\nDisease\\nMain article: List of feline diseases\\nAbout 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism.[169] The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases.[170][171] Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis. Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas.[172]\\n\\nEcology\\nHabitats\\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world.[58] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands.[173][174] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world\\'s most invasive species.[175] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants.[176] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.[177]\\n\\nThe unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofold. On one hand, as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, possibly also the Iberian Peninsula, and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as Kruger National Park in South Africa.[178][55] On the other hand, and perhaps more obviously, its introduction to places where no native felines are present contributes to the decline of native species.[179]\\n\\nFerality\\nMain article: Feral cat\\n\\nFeral farm cat\\nFeral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.[10] The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million.[10] Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.[180] Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.[181]\\n\\nPublic attitudes toward feral cats vary widely, from seeing them as free-ranging pets to regarding them as vermin.[182]\\n\\nSome feral cats can be successfully socialized and \\'re-tamed\\' for adoption; young cats, especially kittens[183] and cats that have had prior experience and contact with humans are the most receptive to these efforts.\\n\\nImpact on wildlife\\nMain article: Cat predation on wildlife\\nOn islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat\\'s diet.[184] In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a \"mesopredator release\" effect;[185] where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail,[143] and the New Zealand merganser[186] are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall\\'s wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.[187][188] One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days.[189] In the US, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 – 22.3 billion mammals annually.[141]\\n\\nIn Australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss.[190] More than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 species.[191] Cats have contributed to the extinction of the Navassa curly-tailed lizard and Chioninia coctei.[179]\\n\\nInteraction with humans\\nMain article: Human interaction with cats\\nA long-haired calico cat sat in the lap of a man who is sat cross-legged on the floor.\\nA cat sleeping on a man\\'s lap\\nCats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million.[192] Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day.[193][194]\\n\\nAs well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade[195] and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, stuffed toys,[196] shoes, gloves, and musical instruments.[197] About 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat.[198] This use has been outlawed in the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the United Kingdom) since 2007.[199]\\n\\nCat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft,[200] and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as traditional medicine thought to cure rheumatism.[201]\\n\\nA few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies[202]) and over the Internet,[203][204] but such a task does not seem simple to achieve. General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.[205][206][207][208][209] Walter Chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of Loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the world. He is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime.[210]\\n\\nShows\\nMain article: Cat show\\nA cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.[211] It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated in order to participate in a cat show.[211] Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion (\"moggy\") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization. Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament.[211]\\n\\nInfection\\nMain article: Feline zoonosis\\nCats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.[212] In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease.[213] The same disease can then become evident in a human. The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected. Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat\\'s body.[212][214] Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis.[213]\\n\\nHistory and mythology\\nMain articles: Cultural depictions of cats and Cats in ancient Egypt\\nIn ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.[215]\\n\\nAncient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for \\'cat\\' was ailouros, meaning \\'thing with the waving tail\\'. Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature. Aristotle remarked in his History of Animals that \"female cats are naturally lecherous.\" The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet\\'s associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses, when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana turns into a cat.[216][217]\\n\\nCats eventually displaced weasels as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. During the Middle Ages, many of Artemis\\'s associations with cats were grafted onto the Virgin Mary. Cats are often shown in icons of Annunciation and of the Holy Family and, according to Italian folklore, on the same night that Mary gave birth to Jesus, a cat in Bethlehem gave birth to a kitten.[218] Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery, as ships\\' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.[49]\\n\\nSeveral ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune.[219] In Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.[220] In Jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man Adam as a pet that got rid of mice. The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. It is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water.[221] Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims. Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza.[222] He is reported to have loved cats so much, \"he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it\".[223] The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed ar-Rifa\\'i, centuries after Muhammad.[224] One of the companions of Muhammad was known as Abu Hurayrah (\"father of the kitten\"), in reference to his documented affection to cats.[225]\\n\\n\\nThe ancient Egyptians mummified dead cats out of respect in the same way that they mummified people[4]\\n\\nAncient Roman mosaic of a cat killing a partridge from the House of the Faun in Pompeii\\n\\nA 19th-century drawing of a tabby cat\\nSuperstitions and rituals\\n\\nSome cultures are superstitious about black cats, ascribing either good or bad luck to them.\\nMany cultures have negative superstitions about cats. An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat (\"crossing one\\'s path\") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches\\' familiars used to augment a witch\\'s powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade).[226] In mid-16th century France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to Norman Davies, the assembled people \"shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized\".[227]\\n\\nJames Frazer wrote that \"It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 Louis XIV, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At Metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly, at Gap, in the department of the Hautes-Alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.\"[228]\\n\\nAccording to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,[229][230] while in Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.[231] An early mention of the myth can be found in John Heywood\\'s The Proverbs of John Heywood (1546):\\n\\nHusband, (quoth she), ye studie, be merrie now,\\nAnd even as ye thinke now, so come to yow.\\nNay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right,\\nI thinke how you lay groning, wife, all last night.\\nHusband, a groning horse and a groning wife\\nNever faile their master, (quoth she), for my life.\\nNo wife, a woman hath nine lives like a cat.\\n\\n—\\u2009Julian Sharman, The Proverbs of John Heywood (1874), p.104\\nThe myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.[citation needed] Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.[232]',\n",
              " 'The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog\\'s nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]\\n\\nThe dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of \"man\\'s best friend\".[14]\\n\\nTaxonomy\\nFurther information: Canis lupus dingo § Taxonomic debate – the domestic dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog\\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning \"dog\",[15] and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus.[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid.[16]\\n\\nIn 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other.[17] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris, as named by Linnaeus in 1758 and, dingo named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstromi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA study as one of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo together under the \"domestic dog\" clade[18] with some debating it.[19]\\n\\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission\\'s Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.[4]\\n\\nEvolution\\nMain article: Evolution of the wolf\\n\\nLocation of a dog\\'s carnassials; the inside of the 4th upper premolar aligns with the outside of the 1st lower molar, working like scissor blades\\nDomestication\\nMain article: Domestication of the dog\\nThe earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.[20] The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper.[21] Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated[22] because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.[1]\\n\\nThis timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] in the time of hunter–gatherers,[7] which predates agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.[6][7] Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the Kesslerloch [de] cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago.[23] This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[8][1][24] with the modern wolf being the dog\\'s nearest living relative.[8]\\n\\nThe dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication.[22][25] The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades.[9] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia.[10] In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.[20]\\n\\nBreeds\\nMain article: Dog breed\\nFurther information: Dog type\\n\\nDog breeds show a huge range of phenotypic variation\\nDogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.[10] In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[8] Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,[8][10] and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today\\'s modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[8] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,[8] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression,[10] which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[8] As a result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.[10] The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.[7]\\n\\n\\nBangladeshi Dog\\nBiology\\nAnatomy\\nMain article: Dog anatomy\\nSkeleton\\n\\nA lateral view of a dog skeleton\\nAll healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.[26][27] The dog\\'s skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great flexibility.[26][27]\\n\\nCompared to the dog\\'s wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog\\'s skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and corgis.[27] Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.[26]\\n\\nThe dog\\'s skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types.[27][28] The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.[27][28]\\n\\nSenses\\nFurther information: Dog anatomy § Senses\\nA dog\\'s senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch. One study suggested that dogs can feel Earth\\'s magnetic field.[29]\\n\\nCoat\\nMain article: Dog coat\\n\\nDogs display wide variation in coat type, density, length, color, and composition\\nThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.[30] Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.[31]\\n\\nTail\\nThere are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog\\'s tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.\\n\\nHealth\\nMain article: Dog health\\nSome breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms, which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.\\n\\nSeveral human foods and household ingestible are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol.[32] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.[33][page needed]\\n\\nDogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.\\n\\nLifespan\\nFurther information: Aging in dogs\\nThe typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13 years.[34][35] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[34][35][36] For dogs in England, increased body weight has been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan), and mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs.[37]\\n\\nReproduction\\nMain article: Canine reproduction\\n\\nA female dog nursing newborn puppies.\\nIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.[12]\\n\\nFertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.[38][39]\\n\\nDogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,[12][40] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies.[41]\\n\\nNeutering\\nNeutering is the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male\\'s testicles or the female\\'s ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs\\' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized.[42]\\n\\nAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized each year.[43] Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[44]\\n\\nNeutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.[45] Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[46][page needed] However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs[47] and prostate cancer in males[48] and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[49]\\n\\nInbreeding depression\\nA common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g., between half and full siblings).[50] Inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.[51] Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.[52]\\n\\nIn a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany, German Shepherd Dog, Leonberger, and West Highland White Terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.[53] Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.[54] In a study of Boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.[55]\\n\\nBehavior\\nMain article: Dog behavior\\nSee also: Dog behavior § Behavior compared with other canids\\nDog swimming over to catch a ball, pay attention to the leg and tail movements\\nDog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.[56] As the oldest domesticated species, dogs\\' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[13] Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the dog\\'s closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children\\'s social-cognitive skills.[57]\\n\\nUnlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[58][59] In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs.[60] These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response[59][61] (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing.[59] Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.[59][62] Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation.[59] Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.[63]\\n\\nIntelligence\\nMain article: Dog intelligence\\nDog intelligence is the dog\\'s ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words.[64] Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands.\\n\\nOne study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs\\' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats.[65] One limited study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focused on the \"what\" of a task rather than the \"where\".[66]\\n\\nDogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.[67] An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.[68] Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.[69]\\n\\nCommunication\\nMain article: Dog communication\\n\\nDog sounds\\n0:15\\nA dog making noises and barking\\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\\nDog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.[70]:\\u200axii\\u200a Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture.\\n\\nEcology\\nPopulation\\nThe dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment.[71][72] In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million[73] and 987 million.[74] About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries.[75] In the developing world, dogs are typically feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).[76] Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.[77]\\n\\nCompetitors and predators\\nAlthough dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs\\' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.[71] For example, a review of the studies in dogs\\' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.[78][79] Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.[78][80]\\n\\nWolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.[81] In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.[82] Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.[78]\\n\\nCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size.[83] Siberian tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. This indicates that the dogs were targeted. Amur tigers will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way.[84] Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range.[85]\\n\\nDiet\\nSee also: Dog food\\n\\nA Golden Retriever gnawing on a pig\\'s foot\\nDogs have been described as omnivores.[12][86][87] Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[11] Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high starch diet.[88] However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh. Also more like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.[89]\\n\\nRange\\nAs a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included:\\n\\nThe Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent\\nThe Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar\\nThe Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species\\nIndividual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands,[90] Palau[91] and most of the Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro,[92] the Marshall Islands,[93] the Gilbert Islands,[93] New Caledonia,[94] Vanuatu,[94][95] Tonga,[95] Marquesas,[95] Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island,[95] the Chatham Islands[96] and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).[97]\\nDogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs, but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.[98]\\n\\nRoles with humans\\nDomestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with a complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations. These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals today.[99]\\n\\nThe dogs\\' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and aiding disabled individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname \"man\\'s best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.[100][101]\\n\\nPets\\n\\nSiberian Huskies are pack animals that still enjoy some human companionship\\nIt is estimated that three-quarters of the world\\'s dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.[102][page needed]\\n\\n\"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs\"[103] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[14] Pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[14] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[104] (the expression \"in the doghouse\" - recorded since 1932[105] - to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children\\'s playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog\\'s role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[106][page needed] People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other\\'s lives[107][page needed] to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced.[108]\\n\\nThere have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs\\' changing status. The first has been \"commodification\", shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior.[108] The second has been the broadening of the family\\'s concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[108]\\n\\nA vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[109] The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[109] Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[110]\\n\\nThe majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.[108] Some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships. However, it has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\" is characteristic of dog-human interactions.[111] The idea of the \"alpha dog\" trying to be dominant is based on a disproved theory about wolf packs.[112][113] Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other.[114]\\n\\nIncreasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog\\'s perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.[109]\\n\\nAccording to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs.[115] The same source shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of male and female pet dogs. Although several programs promote pet adoption, less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters.[115]\\n\\nA study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.[116]\\n\\nWorkers\\nDogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. In addition to dogs\\' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs),[117][page needed][12] hunting (hounds, pointers)[118][page needed] and rodent control (terriers).[12] Other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs,[119] detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs[120] or chemical weapons;[121] guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads.[12] In 1957, the dog Laika became the first animal to be launched into Earth orbit, aboard the Soviets\\' Sputnik 2; she died during the flight.[122][123]\\n\\nVarious kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities.[124][125] Some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.[126]\\n\\nAthletes and models\\nSee also: Conformation show\\nPeople often enter their dogs in competitions, such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions. In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the dog\\'s externally observable qualities (such as appearance, movement and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.\\n\\nFood\\nMain article: Dog meat\\nDog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea,[127][page needed] China,[100] Vietnam[101] and the Philippines,[128] which dates back to antiquity.[129] Based on limited data, it is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year.[130] In China, debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat.[131] Following the Sui and Tang dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern China\\'s plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to Buddhism and Islam\\'s spread, two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals, including the dog. As members of the upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward.[citation needed] Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.[132] Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. Dog fat is also reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs in some parts of Poland[133][134] and Central Asia.[135][136] Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals\\' meat.[137][138][139][140]\\n\\nIn Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the Nureongi, differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.[141]\\n\\nThe most popular Korean dog dish is called bosintang, a spicy stew meant to balance the body\\'s heat during the summer months. Followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one\\'s gi, or the body\\'s vital energy. A 19th-century version of bosintang explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still prevalent in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, pork and chicken.[141]\\n\\nHealth risks\\nFurther information: Dog bite, Canine vector-borne disease, and Dog bite prevention\\nIn 2018, the WHO reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies, with 59.6% in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most important vector.[142] Significant dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. Children in mid-to-late childhood are the largest percentage bitten by dogs, with a greater risk of injury to the head and neck. They are more likely to need medical treatment and have the highest death rate.[143] Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.[144]\\n\\nIn the U.S., cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year.[145] It has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K. hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.[146]\\n\\nToxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected.[147] Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision.[148] Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.[149][150]\\n\\nHealth benefits\\n\\nWalking a dog\\nDogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurologic disorders. Their pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. Researchers are identifying the genes associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders, but lack mouse models to find cures for both dogs and humans. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans\\' related pathways.[10]\\n\\nThe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog\\'s companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being.[151] Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being[152] have been criticized for being poorly controlled.[153] It found that \"the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal.\" Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.[154]\\n\\nA 2005 paper states \"recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.\"[151] In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition. This effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[155]\\n\\nPeople with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term.[155] Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[156] The association between dog ownership and adult physical activity levels has been reviewed by several authors.[157]\\n\\nThe health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog\\'s presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety.[158] Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[159] One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[160] In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.[161]\\n\\nUsing dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[162] Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer\\'s disease.[163] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.[164]\\n\\nCultural importance\\nMain articles: Cultural depictions of dogs and Dogs in religion\\nFurther information: List of fictional dogs\\n\\nCerberus, with the gluttons in Dante\\'s Third Circle of Hell. William Blake.\\nDogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, alertness, and love.[165] In ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine,[166] and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her.[166] In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection.[166] In China, Korea and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[167]\\n\\nIn mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.[167] Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies[168][169] and may originate from Proto-Indo-European religion.[168][169] In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed, dragon-tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades.[167] Dogs are also associated with the Greek goddess Hecate.[170] In Norse mythology, a dog called Garmr guards Hel, a realm of the dead.[167] In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge.[167] In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by Cŵn Annwn.[167] In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.[171] A black dog is also considered to be the vahana (vehicle) of Bhairava (an incarnation of Shiva).[172]\\n\\nIn Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[167] Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the saint\\'s mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that.[173] As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis) means \"dog of the Lord\" or \"hound of the Lord\" (Ecclesiastical Latin: Domini canis).[173] In Christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege.[174] Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.[citation needed] The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean,[167] although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet.\"[175] Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.[176]',\n",
              " 'A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world\\'s oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.\\n\\nThe word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.\\n\\nAs of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion deadweight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships.[1]\\n\\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE [2]\\n\\nNomenclature\\nFurther information: Glossary of nautical terms (A-L) and Glossary of nautical terms (M-Z)\\n\\nMain parts of ship. 1:  Funnel; 2: Stern; 3: Propeller and Rudder; 4: Portside (the right side is known as starboard); 5: Anchor; 6: Bulbous bow; 7: Bow; 8: Deck; 9: Superstructure\\nShips are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats.[3] A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea.[4] A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa.[5] A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned.[6] A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside[7] because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy.[8][9] American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished \"vessels\" from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.[10]\\n\\nParticularly in the Age of Sail, the word ship might apply generally to a seagoing vessel or particularly to a full-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, all square-rigged. Other rigs on seagoing vessels included brig, barque, and barquentine.[11]:\\u200a8\\u200a[12]:\\u200a2\\u200a[13]:\\u200a222\\u200a\\n\\nSome large vessels are traditionally called boats, notably submarines.[14] Others include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.[10]\\n\\nIn most maritime traditions ships have individual names, and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named after its first ship.\\n\\nIn many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example \"MS\" (motor ship) or \"SV\" (sailing vessel), making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.\\n\\n\"Ship\" (along with \"nation\") is an English word that has retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which allows it sometimes to be referred to as a \"she\" without being of female natural gender.[15]\\n\\nHistory\\nFurther information: Maritime history and Sailing ship\\nPrehistory and antiquity\\nAsian developments\\n\\nFijian voyaging outrigger boat with a crab claw sail\\n\\nOne of the sailing trimarans depicted in Borobudur temple, c. 8th century AD in Java, Indonesia\\nThe earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for \"ship\" is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500–2350 BCE.[citation needed]\\n\\nAustronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been deduced that they had sails some time before 2000 BCE.[16]:\\u200a144\\u200a Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.[17][18]\\n\\nAustronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails (and sometimes in between).[17][18] The sails were also made from woven leaves, usually from pandan plants.[19][20] These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the outriggers in the larger boats.[17][21] Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple dugout canoes with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.[18][21]\\n\\nEarly Austronesian sailors influenced the development of sailing technologies in Sri Lanka and Southern India through the Austronesian maritime trade network of the Indian Ocean, the precursor to the spice trade route and the maritime silk road, which was established at around 1500 BC.[22] Some scholars believe that the triangular Austronesian crab claw sail may have influenced the development of the lateen sail in western ships due to early contact.[18] The junk rigs of Chinese ships is also believed to be developed from tilted sails.[23]:\\u200a612–613\\u200a[24]\\n\\nIn the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4–7 m out of the water. They could carry 600–1000 people and 250–1000 ton cargo. These ships were known as kunlun bo or k\\'unlun po (崑崙舶, lit. \"ship of the Kunlun people\") by the Chinese, and kolandiaphonta by the Greeks. They had 4–7 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana.[25]:\\u200a41\\u200a[26]:\\u200a262\\u200a[27]:\\u200a347\\u200a In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali.[28]:\\u200a222,\\u200a230,\\u200a267\\u200a[29]:\\u200a82\\u200a This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the kunlun bo which used vegetal fibres for lashings.[30]:\\u200a138\\u200a\\n\\nIn China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC).[31] By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Sternpost-mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD.[31] However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy.[32]:\\u200a20\\u200a[33] The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th century AD Song Dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian k\\'un-lun po trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.[24][32]:\\u200a20–21\\u200a\\n\\nMediterranean developments\\n\\nEgyptian sailing ship, c. 1422–1411 BC\\n\\nA Roman ship carved on the face of the \"Ship Sarcophagus\", c. 2nd century AD\\nThe earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE [2] The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: \"During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.\"[34] Sneferu\\'s ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.[35]\\n\\nThe ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats.

It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques.[according to whom?] During the 15th century, China\\'s Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world\\'s first iron-clads, \"Tekkōsen\" (鉄甲船), literally meaning \"iron ships\",[38] was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, \"Geobukseon\"(거북선), was developed.\\n\\nThe empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas.[39]:\\u200a115\\u200a The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length.[40]:\\u200a60–62\\u200a The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.[41]\\n\\nEuropean developments\\n\\nReplica of Magellan\\'s Victoria. Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano led the first expedition that circumnavigated the globe in 1519–1522.\\nSeveral civilizations became sea powers. Such examples include the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice, Hanseatic League, and the Byzantine navy. The Vikings used their knarrs to explore North America, trade in the Baltic Sea and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.\\n\\nTowards the end of the 14th century, ships like the carrack began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessel\\'s stability, and in the 15th century, the caravel, designed by the Portuguese, based on the Arabic qarib[citation needed] which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the forecastle and sterncastle, as in the carrack Santa María of Christopher Columbus. This increased freeboard allowed another innovation: the freeing port, and the artillery associated with it.\\n\\nThe carrack was developed in Portugal, the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, then the caravel was developed in Portugal and the galleon was developed in Spain. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.[42] In 1498, by reaching India, Vasco da Gama proved that access to the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic was possible. These explorations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606 and New Zealand in 1642.[43] After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth.[44]\\n\\nSpecialization and modernization\\n\\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the industrial revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\\n\\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were 56 metres (184 ft) long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and 40 kilometres (25 mi) of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.\\n\\nDuring the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. A clipper was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The clipper routes fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of steam ships with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the Suez and Panama Canals.\\n\\nShip designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.\\n\\n21st century\\n\\nColombo Express, one of the largest container ships in the world, owned and operated by Hapag-Lloyd of Germany\\nIn 2019, the world\\'s fleet included 51,684 commercial vessels with gross tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 1.96 billion tons.[46] Such ships carried 11 billion tons of cargo in 2018, a sum that grew by 2.7% over the previous year.[47] In terms of tonnage, 29% of ships were tankers, 43% are bulk carriers, 13% container ships and 15% were other types.[48]\\n\\nIn 2008, there were 1,240 warships operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as patrol boats. The United States accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, Russia 1.35 million tons, the United Kingdom 504,660 tons and China 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two world wars, the Cold War, and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world\\'s major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands and the United States in Iraq.\\n\\nThe size of the world\\'s fishing fleet is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. Fishing vessels can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated 4 million fishing vessels were operating worldwide.[49] The same study estimated that the world\\'s 29 million fishermen[50] caught 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish and shellfish that year.[51]\\n\\nTypes of ships\\nSee also: List of types of naval vessels and List of boat types\\n\\nShip carrying containers in Gadiara (West Bengal, India)\\nBecause ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles,[52] which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:[53]\\n\\nHigh-speed craft – Multihulls including wave piercers, small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH), surface effect ships and hovercraft, hydrofoil, wing in ground effect craft (WIG).\\nOff shore oil vessels – Platform supply vessel, pipe layers, accommodation and crane barges, non and semi-submersible drilling rigs, drill ships, production platforms, floating production storage and offloading units.\\nFishing vessels\\nMotorised fishing trawlers, trap setters, seiners, longliners, trollers & factory ships.\\nTraditional sailing and rowed fishing vessels and boats used for handline fishing\\nHarbour work craft\\nCable layers\\nTugboats, dredgers, salvage vessels, tenders, pilot boats.\\nFloating dry docks, floating cranes, lightership.\\nDry cargo ships – tramp freighters, bulk carriers, cargo liners, container vessels, barge carriers, Ro-Ro ships, refrigerated cargo ships, timber carriers, livestock carriers & light vehicle carriers.\\nLiquid cargo ships – oil tankers, liquefied gas carriers, chemical carriers.\\nPassenger vessels\\nLiners, cruise and special trade passenger (STP) ships\\nCross-channel, coastal and harbour ferries\\nLuxury and cruising yachts and superyachts\\nSail training and multi-masted ships\\nRecreational boats and craft – rowed, masted and motorised craft\\nSpecial-purpose vessels – weather and research vessels, deep sea survey vessels, and icebreakers.\\nSubmersibles – industrial exploration, scientific research, tourist and hydrographic survey.\\nNaval ships, warships, other surface combatants and auxiliary ships – aircraft carriers, amphibious warfare ships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, patrol ships, minesweepers, etc.\\nHospital ships\\nSome of these are discussed in the following sections.\\n\\nInland vessels\\n\\nPassenger ship of Köln-Düsseldorfer on the river Rhine\\n\\nHurma, Hans and Voima at the Lake Saimaa in the harbour of Imatra, Finland, at a heritage ship meeting in 2009\\nFreshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those body of waters may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze and Amazon Rivers, and the Great Lakes.\\n\\nGreat Lakes\\nLake freighters, also called lakers, are cargo vessels that ply the Great Lakes. The most well-known is SS Edmund Fitzgerald, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties\". Because of their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because the smallest of the Soo Locks is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.\\n\\nSince the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50 years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20 years of age.[54]\\n\\nSS St. Marys Challenger, built in 1906 as William P Snyder, was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, E.M. Ford, built in 1898 as Presque Isle, was sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. As of 2007 E.M. Ford was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw, Michigan.\\n\\nMerchant ship\\nMain article: Merchant ship\\n\\nTwo modern container ships in San Francisco\\nMerchant ships are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing vessels, cargo ships, passenger ships, and special-purpose ships.[55] The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and \"other ships\", which includes \"liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo\". General cargo ships include \"multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo\".[1]\\n\\nModern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine.,[56] but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines.[citation needed] Most commercial vessels have full hull-forms to maximize cargo capacity.[citation needed] Hulls are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass on the smallest service vessels.[citation needed] Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a sea captain, with deck officers and engine officers on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.\\n\\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than 30 meters (98 ft) but up to 100 metres (330 ft) for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery.[57] Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10,700,000 tonnes (10,500,000 long tons; 11,800,000 short tons).[57] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna.[57] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.\\n\\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general cargo ship in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and gas carriers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.[58]\\n\\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large cruise ships. This type of vessel includes ferries, which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; ocean liners, which carry passengers from one place to another; and cruise ships, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. Riverboats and inland ferries are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\\n\\n\\nAlbatun Dos, a tuna boat at work near Victoria, Seychelles\\nFishing vessels are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world\\'s fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels.[49] Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels.[49] Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.[49] More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels[note 1] were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.[59]\\n\\nSpecial purpose vessels\\nMain article: Weather ship\\n\\nThe weather ship MS Polarfront at sea.\\nA weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily.[60] It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights.[60][61] Proposed as early as 1927 by the aviation community,[62] the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States.[61] This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.[63]\\n\\nThe weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches.[60] Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons.[64] They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones.[65] The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987.[66] Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by weather buoys due to the ships\\' significant cost.[67] The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M (\"Mike\"), which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.\\n\\nNaval vessels\\n\\nAmerican aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and a replenishment ship\\nNaval ships are diverse in types of vessel. They include: surface warships, submarines, and auxiliary ships.\\n\\nModern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines and amphibious warfare ships. The distinctions among cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes are not codified; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. Battleships were used during the Second World War and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of carrier-borne aircraft and guided missiles.[68]\\n\\nMost military submarines are either attack submarines or ballistic missile submarines. Until the end of World War II the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of submarine-launched nuclear and cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster munitions to nuclear weapons.\\n\\nMost navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, and hospital ships which are designated medical treatment facilities.[69]\\n\\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability.[70] They also usually have advanced marine electronics and communication systems, as well as weapons.\\n\\nArchitecture\\nFurther information: Naval architecture\\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it\\'s a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\\n\\nHull\\nMain article: Hull (watercraft)\\n\\nA ship\\'s hull endures harsh conditions at sea, as illustrated by this reefer ship in bad weather.\\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship\\'s hull.[71] There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of America\\'s Cup sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of catamarans, or three in the case of trimarans. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\\n\\nHulls have several elements. The bow is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship\\'s rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel\\'s work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.\\n\\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\\n\\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and composite materials are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with concrete hulls.\\n\\nPropulsion systems\\nMain article: Marine propulsion\\n\\nA ship\\'s engine room\\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, which was used even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\\n\\nMechanical propulsion systems generally consist of a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts to use them to power commercial vessels (see NS Savannah).\\n\\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel-electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship\\'s generators.\\n\\nSteering systems\\n\\nThe rudder and propeller on a newly built ferry\\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles,[note 2] steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.\\n\\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the outboard motor, the bow thruster, and the Z-drive.\\n\\nHolds, compartments, and the superstructure\\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate berthings and heads are found on sailboats over about 25 feet (7.6 m). Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a galley, and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship\\'s trim and modify its stability.\\n\\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship\\'s stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\\n\\nEquipment\\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship\\'s era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:[citation needed]\\n\\nMasts can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.\\nGround tackle comprises the anchor, its chain or cable, and connecting fittings.[72]\\nCargo equipment such as cranes and cargo booms may be used to load and unload cargo and ship\\'s stores.\\nSafety equipment such as lifeboats, liferafts, and survival suits are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.\\nDesign considerations\\nHydrostatics\\nMain article: Fluid statics\\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, so that the downwards force of gravity equals the upward force of buoyancy. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel\\'s mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its beam (width). A vessel\\'s stability is considered in both this hydrostatic sense as well as a hydrodynamic sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.[73]\\n\\nHydrodynamics\\nMain article: Fluid dynamics\\n\\nAerial view of the German battleship Schlesien, showing a 39° wake, characteristic of vessels passing through water.\\n\\nVessels move along the three axes: 1. heave, 2. sway, 3. surge, 4. yaw, 5. pitch, 6. roll\\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. Antifouling paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.\\n\\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.\\n\\nThis hull speed is found by the formula:\\n\\nknots\\n≈\\n1.34\\n×\\n�\\nft\\n{\\\\mbox{knots}}\\\\approx 1.34\\\\times {\\\\sqrt  {L{\\\\mbox{ft}}}}\\nor, in metric units:\\n\\nknots\\n≈\\n2.5\\n×\\n�\\nm\\n{\\\\mbox{knots}}\\\\approx 2.5\\\\times {\\\\sqrt  {L{\\\\mbox{m}}}}\\nwhere L is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\\n\\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its bow wave, and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\\n\\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of computational fluid dynamics.\\n\\nVessels are also subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell as well as effects of wind and weather. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\\n\\nLifecycle\\n\\nLines plan for the hull of a basic cargo ship\\n\\nMS Freedom of the Seas under construction in a shipyard in Turku.\\nA ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the shipowners, operators, designers and the shipyard. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from shipwrecks to service as a museum ship to the scrapyard.\\n\\nDesign\\nSee also: Naval architecture\\nA vessel\\'s design starts with a specification, which a naval architect uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship\\'s propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship\\'s design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\\n\\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\\n\\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be disassembled or disposed easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\\n\\nConstruction\\nMain article: Shipbuilding\\n\\nA ship launching at the Northern Shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland\\nShip construction takes place in a shipyard, and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate Hermione, to more than 10 years for an aircraft carrier. During World War II, the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for Liberty Ships went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.[74][75][76]\\n\\nHull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\\n\\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about 30 meters (98 ft), by the laying of the keel. This is done in a drydock or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\\n\\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. Ship launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vendée Globe class sailboat. A 25 meters (82 ft) trawler may cost $2.5 million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. A ship\\'s cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20 million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35 million, a supertanker around $105 million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200 million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a Seawolf-class submarine costs around $2 billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5 billion.\\n\\nRepair and conversion\\n\\nAble seaman using a needlegun scaler on a mooring winch.\\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\\n\\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a drydock at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, sandblasting and repainting the hull, and replacing sacrificial anodes used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\\n\\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: oil tankers are often converted into floating production storage and offloading units.\\n\\nEnd of service\\nMain article: Ship disposal\\n\\nWorkers drag steel plate ashore from beached ships in Chittagong, Bangladesh\\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30 years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40 years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100 years.\\n\\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be scuttled at sea or scrapped by shipbreakers. Ships can also be used as museum ships, or expended to construct breakwaters or artificial reefs.\\n\\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, grounding, or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during World War II.[77]\\n\\nMeasuring ships\\nOne can measure ships in terms of length overall, length between perpendiculars, length of the ship at the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\\n\\nIn Britain until Samuel Plimsoll\\'s Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship\\'s hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"Plimsoll Line\", exists on ships\\' sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the \"freeboard mark\" or \"load line mark\" in the marine industry.\\n\\nShip pollution\\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by shipping. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world\\'s oceans and waterways as globalization continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\"[78] Because of increased traffic in ocean ports, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects biodiversity, climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30 years.\\n\\nOil spills\\nMain article: Oil spill\\n\\nThe tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 10,800,000 US gallons (8,993,000 imp gal; 40,880,000 L) of oil into Alaska\\'s Prince William Sound.[79]\\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment.[80] Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.\\n\\nBy the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry 2 million barrels (318,000 m3) of crude oil, or 84,000,000 US gallons (69,940,000 imp gal; 318,000,000 L). This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known Exxon Valdez incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped 10,800,000 US gallons (8,993,000 imp gal; 40,880,000 L) of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.[80]\\n\\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974.[81] According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.[81] 91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7 tons per spill.[81] Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 tons.[81]\\n\\nFollowing the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be double-hulled by 2015. Following the sinkings of Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".[82]\\n\\nBallast water\\nMain article: Ballast water discharge and the environment\\n\\nA cargo ship pumps ballast water over the side\\nWhen a large vessel such as a container ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.[83]\\n\\nOne of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz[84] believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless planktonic organism . Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species of comb jelly that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Valdés peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship\\'s ballast water. The population of the comb jelly shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. \"The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tonnes (225,000 short tons; 201,000 long tons) in 1984 to 200 tonnes (220 short tons; 197 long tons) in 1993; sprat from 24,600 tonnes (27,100 short tons; 24,200 long tons) in 1984 to 12,000 tonnes (13,200 short tons; 11,800 long tons) in 1993; horse mackerel from 4,000 tonnes (4,410 short tons; 3,940 long tons) in 1984 to zero in 1993.\"[84] Now that the comb jellies have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the comb jellies have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. \"On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.\"[80]\\n\\nBallast and bilge discharge from ships can also spread human pathogens and other harmful diseases and toxins potentially causing health issues for humans and marine life alike.[85] Discharges into coastal waters, along with other sources of marine pollution, have the potential to be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.[80]\\n\\nExhaust emissions\\n\\nExhaust stack on a container ship.\\nExhaust emissions from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution. \"Seagoing vessels are responsible for an estimated 14 percent of emissions of nitrogen from fossil fuels and 16 percent of the emissions of sulfur from petroleum uses into the atmosphere.\"[80] In Europe ships make up a large percentage of the sulfur introduced to the air, \"as much sulfur as all the cars, lorries and factories in Europe put together\".[86] \"By 2010, up to 40% of air pollution over land could come from ships.\"[86] Sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of a heart attack.[86]\\n\\nShip breaking\\nMain article: Ship breaking\\nShip breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\\n\\n\\nShip breaking near Chittagong, Bangladesh\\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers\\' health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\\n\\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major environmental concern. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.[87]',\n",
              " 'A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura[1] (ανοὐρά, literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil \"proto-frog\" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.\\n\\nAn adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living underground or in trees.\\n\\nFrogs typically lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on plant matter. Frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world\\'s ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.\\n\\nFrogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion. They are also seen as environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often viewed as early warning signs of environmental damage. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.\\n\\nEtymology and taxonomy\\nThe use of the common names frog and toad has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered \"true toads\". The use of the term frog in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term toad generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.[2][3] There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat[4] whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.[5]\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe origin of the order name Anura—and its original spelling Anoures—is the Ancient Greek \"alpha privative\" prefix ἀν- (an- from ἀ- before a vowel) \\'without\\',[6] and οὐρά (ourá) \\'animal tail\\'.[7] meaning \"tailless\". It refers to the tailless character of these amphibians.[8][9][10]\\n\\nThe origins of the word frog are uncertain and debated.[11] The word is first attested in Old English as frogga, but the usual Old English word for the frog was frosc (with variants such as frox and forsc), and it is agreed that the word frog is somehow related to this. Old English frosc remained in dialectal use in English as frosh and frosk into the nineteenth century,[12] and is paralleled widely in other Germanic languages, with examples in the modern languages including German Frosch, Norwegian frosk, Icelandic froskur, and Dutch (kik)vors.[11] These words allow reconstruction of a Common Germanic ancestor *froskaz.[13] The third edition of the Oxford English Dictionary finds that the etymology of *froskaz is uncertain, but agrees with arguments that it could plausibly derive from a Proto-Indo-European base along the lines of *preu, meaning \\'jump\\'.[11]\\n\\nHow Old English frosc gave rise to frogga is, however, uncertain, as the development does not involve a regular sound-change. Instead, it seems that there was a trend in Old English to coin nicknames for animals ending in -g, with examples—themselves all of uncertain etymology—including dog, hog, pig, stag, and (ear)wig. Frog appears to have been adapted from frosc as part of this trend.[11]\\n\\nMeanwhile, the word toad, first attested as Old English tādige, is unique to English and is likewise of uncertain etymology.[14] It is the basis for the word tadpole, first attested as Middle English taddepol, apparently meaning \\'toad-head\\'.[15]\\n\\nTaxonomy\\nAbout 88% of amphibian species are classified in the order Anura.[16] These include over 7,500 species[1] in 55 families, of which the Craugastoridae (850 spp.), Hylidae (724 spp.), Microhylidae (688 spp.), and Bufonidae (621 spp.) are the richest in species.[17]\\n\\nDark-colored toad facing left\\nEuropean fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina)\\nThe Anura include all modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The characteristics of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without teeth (with the exception of Gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea),[18] an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye.[19] The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.[19]\\n\\nPanamanian golden frog\\nPanamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki).\\nFrogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, by far the largest group, which contains the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The suborder Neobatrachia is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea.[20] This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.[21]\\n\\nSome species of anurans hybridize readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus).[22] The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata are similar in forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.[23]\\n\\nEvolution\\nThe origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split.[24] Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea.[25] Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data.[26] A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.[27]\\n\\n\\nA fossilized frog from the Czech Republic, possibly Palaeobatrachus gigas.\\nIn 2008, Gerobatrachus hottoni, a temnospondyl with many frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was discovered in Texas. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link, a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other (forming a clade called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians.[28][29] However, others have suggested that Gerobatrachus hottoni was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.[30]\\n\\nSalientia (Latin salire (salio), \"to jump\") is the name of the total group that includes modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the \"proto-frogs\" or \"stem-frogs\". The common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping ilium in the pelvis, the presence of a frontoparietal bone, and a lower jaw without teeth. The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are Triadobatrachus massinoti, from the early Triassic period of Madagascar (about 250 million years ago), and Czatkobatrachus polonicus, from the Early Triassic of Poland (about the same age as Triadobatrachus).[31] The skull of Triadobatrachus is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. These include a longer body with more vertebrae. The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs. The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that Triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper.[31] A 2019 study has noted the presence of Salientia from the Chinle Formation, and suggested that anurans might have first appeared during the Late Triassic.[32]\\n\\nOn the basis of fossil evidence, the earliest known \"true frogs\" that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early Jurassic period.[2][33] One such early frog species, Prosalirus bitis, was discovered in 1995 in the Kayenta Formation of Arizona and dates back to the Early Jurassic epoch (199.6 to 175 million years ago), making Prosalirus somewhat more recent than Triadobatrachus.[34] Like the latter, Prosalirus did not have greatly enlarged legs, but had the typical three-pronged pelvic structure of modern frogs. Unlike Triadobatrachus, Prosalirus had already lost nearly all of its tail[35] and was well adapted for jumping.[36] Another Early Jurassic frog is Vieraella herbsti, which is known only from dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be 33 mm (1+1⁄4 in) from snout to vent. Notobatrachus degiustoi from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger, about 155–170 million years old. The main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail. The evolution of modern Anura likely was complete by the Jurassic period. Since then, evolutionary changes in chromosome numbers have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs, which means speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammals.[37]\\n\\nAccording to genetic studies, the families Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.[38][39]\\n\\nFrog fossils have been found on all of the earth\\'s continents.[40][41] In 2020, it was announced that 40 million year old helmeted frog fossils had been discovered by a team of vertebrate paleontologists in Seymour Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, indicating that this region was once home to frogs related to those now living in South American Nothofagus forest.[42]\\n\\nPhylogeny\\nA cladogram showing the relationships of the different families of frogs in the clade Anura can be seen in the table below.

Red marks indicate bones which have been substantially elongated in frogs and joints which have become mobile. Blue indicates joints and bones which have not been modified or only somewhat elongated.\\nFrogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx).[46] Frogs range in size from Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea that is 7.7 mm (0.30 in) in snout–to–vent length[47] to the up to 32 cm (13 in) and 3.25 kg (7.2 lb) goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of central Africa.[48] There are prehistoric, extinct species that reached even larger sizes.[49]\\n\\nFeet and legs\\nThe structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees, or in burrows. Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The ilium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.[46]\\n\\nWebbed foot\\nWebbed hind foot of common frog\\n(Rana temporaria)\\n\\nTyler\\'s tree frog (Litoria tyleri) has large toe pads and webbed feet.\\nThe muscular system has been similarly modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.[50]\\n\\nMany frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water.[51] The completely aquatic African dwarf frog (Hymenochirus sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of White\\'s tree frog (Litoria caerulea), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed.[52] Exceptions include flying frogs in the Hylidae and Rhacophoridae, which also have fully webbed toes used in gliding.\\n\\nArboreal frogs have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.[53]\\n\\nIn many arboreal frogs, a small \"intercalary structure\" on each toe increases the surface area touching the substrate. Furthermore, many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking. Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes. This allows the frogs to \"parachute\" or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another.[54]\\n\\nGround-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch\\'s spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle often referred to as a spade, that helps them to burrow.[55]\\n\\nSometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops one or more extra legs.[56]\\n\\n\\nNorthern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) moulting and eating its skin.\\nSkin\\nA frog\\'s skin is protective, has a respiratory function, can absorb water, and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, particularly on the head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators.[57] The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.[58]\\n\\nBeing cold-blooded, frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body.[59] The colour of a frog\\'s skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.[60]\\n\\nMany frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog\\'s skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Other frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss.[59] Woodhouse\\'s toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate.[61] The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respiration.[62]\\n\\nSome species have bony plates embedded in their skin, a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times.[63] In certain other species, the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).[64][65]\\n\\nCamouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.[66] Some are even able to control their skin texture.[67] The Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour.[68] The Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) uses disruptive coloration including black eye markings similar to voids between leaves, bands of the dorsal skin (dorsolateral dermal plica) similar to a leaf midrib as well as stains, spots & leg stripes similar to fallen leaf features.\\n\\nWood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) uses disruptive coloration\\nWood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) uses disruptive coloration\\n\\n \\nFrog barely recognisable against brown decaying leaf litter.\\nPouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) camouflaged against leaf litter.\\n\\nRespiration and circulation\\nLike other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. Ribs are generally absent, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them.[66] The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.[69]\\n\\nFrogs have three-chambered hearts, a feature they share with lizards. Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood.[70]\\n\\nSome species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. The Titicaca water frog (Telmatobius culeus) is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.[71]\\n\\nDissected frog\\nAnatomical model of a dissected frog: 1 Right atrium, 2 Lungs, 3 Aorta, 4 Egg mass, 5 Colon, 6 Left atrium, 7 Ventricle, 8 Stomach, 9 Liver, 10 Gallbladder, 11 Small intestine, 12 Cloaca\\nDigestion and excretion\\nFrogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch insects and other small moving prey. The tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed.[51] In amphibians there are salvary glands on the tongue, which in frogs produce what is called a two-phase viscoelastic fluid. When exposed to pressure, like when the tongue is wrapping around a prey, it becomes runny and covers the prey\\'s body. As the pressure drops, it returns to a thick and elastic state, which gives the tongue an extra grip.[72] Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands.[51] The African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.[16] The eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat.[51][73]\\n\\nThe food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.[74]\\n\\nAlthough adapted to terrestrial life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules.[75] The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid.[75] The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.[76]\\n\\nReproductive system\\nSee also: Sexual selection in amphibians\\nIn the male frog, the two testes are attached to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.[76]\\n\\nWhen frogs mate, the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This position is called amplexus and may be held for several days.[77] The male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. These include the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold.[78] The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.[76]\\n\\nNervous system\\nFrogs have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions. The relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans. Frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord.[76] By contrast, all amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.[79]\\n\\n\\nClose-up of frog\\'s head showing eye, nostril, mouth and tympanum.\\nSight\\nThe eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°.[80] They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming.[81] Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above.[80] The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.[81]\\n\\nThe distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen.[81] When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended.[51] Although it was formerly debated,[82] more recent research has shown that frogs can see in colour, even in very low light.[83]\\n\\nHearing\\nSurface rendering of the head of the frog Atelopus franciscus, with ear parts highlighted.\\nFrogs can hear both in the air and below water. They do not have external ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size.[84] A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies.[85] Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds.[86] This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state.[85] A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.[84]\\n\\nCall\\nSee also: Sexual selection in frogs\\n\\nA male Dendropsophus microcephalus displaying its vocal sac during its call.\\n1:35\\nAdvertisement call of male Atelopus franciscus\\nThe call or croak of a frog is unique to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile (1.6 km) away.[87] Additionally, some species have been found to use man-made structures such as drain pipes for artificial amplification of their call.[88] The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.[89]\\n\\nThe main function of calling is for male frogs to attract mates. Males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. In many frog species, such as the common tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax), females reply to males\\' calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony.[90] Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.[91]\\n\\nA different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body.[92] Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower.[92] Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed.[92] A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorient the attacker so that it releases the frog.[92]\\n\\n0:45\\nDistinctive low \"jug-o-rum\" sound of banded bullfrog.\\nMany species of frog have deep calls. The croak of the American bullfrog (Rana catesbiana) is sometimes written as \"jug o\\' rum\".[93] The Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) produces the onomatopoeic \"ribbit\" often heard in films.[94] Other renderings of frog calls into speech include \"brekekekex koax koax\", the call of the marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus) in The Frogs, an Ancient Greek comic drama by Aristophanes.[95] The calls of the Concave-eared torrent frog (Amolops tormotus) are unusual in many aspects. The males are notable for their varieties of calls where upward and downward frequency modulations take place. When they communicate, they produce calls that fall in the ultrasound frequency range. The last aspect that makes this species of frog\\'s calls unusual is that nonlinear acoustic phenomena are important components in their acoustic signals.[96]\\n\\nTorpor\\nDuring extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs such as the wood frog, moor frog, or spring peeper can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and its heartbeat can restart when conditions warm up.[97]\\n\\nAt the other extreme, the striped burrowing frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat.[98] Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected.[99] Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.[100]\\n\\nLocomotion\\nDifferent species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including jumping, running, walking, swimming, burrowing, climbing and gliding.\\n\\n\\nRainforest rocket frog jumping.\\nJumping\\nFrogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers and, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates.[101] The striped rocket frog, Litoria nasuta, can leap over two metres (6+1⁄2 feet), a distance that is more than fifty times its body length of 55 mm (2+1⁄4 in).[102] There are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability. Within a species, jump distance increases with increasing size, but relative jumping distance (body-lengths jumped) decreases. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface.[103] The tiny northern cricket frog (Acris crepitans) can \"skitter\" across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps.[104]\\n\\nSlow-motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position for the duration of the jump.[50] In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration.[105] A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.[106]\\n\\nEarly hatching of froglets can have negative effects on frog jumping performance and overall locomotion.[107] The hindlimbs are unable to completely form, which results in them being shorter and much weaker relative to a normal hatching froglet.[107] Early hatching froglets may tend to depend on other forms of locomotion more often, such as swimming and walking.[107]\\n\\nWalking and running\\n\\nPhrynomantis bifasciatus walking on a level surface\\nFrogs in the families Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump.[108] When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) has been described as having a gait that is \"a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length\".[109] In an experiment, Fowler\\'s toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad\\'s uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.[110]\\n\\nThe red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion photography shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog\\'s gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds.[111] This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects.[112] The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run across the surface of the water for several metres (yards).[104]\\n\\nSwimming\\nCommon toad swimming\\nCommon toad (Bufo bufo) swimming.\\nFrogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet.[113] Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.[114]\\n\\nBurrowing\\nSome frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme example of this is the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.[115]\\n\\nPurple frog\\nPurple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis).\\nThe spadefoot toads of North America are also adapted to underground life. The Plains spadefoot toad (Spea bombifrons) is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. As it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil. It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. In winter, it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in).[116] The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. During this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by osmosis to supply the toad\\'s needs.[116] Spadefoot toads are \"explosive breeders\", all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.[117]\\n\\nThe burrowing frogs of Australia have a rather different lifestyle. The western spotted frog (Heleioporus albopunctatus) digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development.[118] Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these, the green burrowing frog (Scaphiophryne marmorata), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes.[119] It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.[120]\\n\\nClimbing\\nFrog climbing\\nBurmeister\\'s leaf frog\\n\\nGroup of glass frogs\\nTree frogs live high in the canopy, where they scramble around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The \"true\" tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the glass frogs (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae).[108] Most tree frogs are under 10 cm (4 in) in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity.[121] Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed.[122] Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.[123]\\n\\nGliding\\nDuring the evolutionary history of frogs, several different groups have independently taken to the air.[124] Some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor. Typical of them is Wallace\\'s flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus) from Malaysia and Borneo. It has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed. Flaps of skin occur on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region. With the digits splayed, the limbs outstretched, and these flaps spread, it can glide considerable distances, but is unable to undertake powered flight.[125] It can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to 15 m (50 ft) between trees.[126]\\n\\nLife history\\n\\nLife cycle of the green frog\\n(Rana clamitans).\\nReproduction\\nTwo main types of reproduction occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. In the former, adopted by the majority of species, adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. In explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. In these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up.[127]\\n\\nAmong prolonged breeders, males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned. This means that males outnumber females at the water\\'s edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. They advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. Larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. Females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice.[128] In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. Calling is an energy-sapping activity. Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.[127]\\n\\n\\nMale and female common toads (Bufo bufo) in amplexus.\\nIn explosive breeders, the first male that finds a suitable breeding location, such as a temporary pool, calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool. Explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away. The spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus spp.) of North America fall into this category. Mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction. In some years, suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding.[127] Some female New Mexico spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata) only spawn half of the available eggs at a time, perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later.[129]\\n\\nAt the breeding site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus takes place in the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes.[127] Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.[130][131][132]\\n\\nLife cycle\\nEggs / frogspawn\\n\\nFrogspawn\\nFrogs may lay their in eggs as clumps, surface films, strings, or individually. Around half of species deposit eggs in water, others lay eggs in vegetation, on the ground or in excavations.[133][134][135] The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil.[136] The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur.[137] The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below.[138]\\n\\nIn certain species, such as the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis.[139] The interior of globular egg clusters of the wood frog has been also been found to be up to 6 °C (11 °F) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae.[140] The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.[141] In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.[142]\\n\\nDirect development, where eggs hatch into juveniles like small adults, is also known in many frogs, for example, Ischnocnema henselii,[143] Eleutherodactylus coqui,[144] and Raorchestes ochlandrae and Raorchestes chalazodes.[145]\\n\\nTadpoles\\n\\nFrogspawn development.\\nThe larvae that emerge from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or occasionally polliwogs). Tadpoles lack eyelids and limbs, and have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and tails they use for swimming.[114] As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, but at least one species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks.[146][147]\\n\\nFrom early in its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole\\'s gills and front legs. The lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification.[142] In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish.[113] Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.[148]\\n\\nTadpoles are typically herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.[149]\\n\\nTadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, particularly water bird, such as storks and herons and domestic ducks. Some tadpoles, including those of the cane toad (Bufo marinus), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.[150]\\n\\nMetamorphosis\\nAt the end of the tadpole stage, a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator.[142] Homeostatic feedback control of food intake is largely absent, making tadpoles eat constantly when food is present. But shortly before and during metamorphosis the sensation of hunger is suppressed, and they stop eating while their gut and internal organs are reorganized and prepared for a different diet.[151][152] Also the gut microbiota changes, from being similar to that of fish to resembling that of amniotes.[153] Exceptions are carnivorous tadpoles like Lepidobatrachus laevis , which has a gut already adapted to a diet similar to that of adults. These continue to eat during metamorphosis.[154] The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding.[142] The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed.[142] The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs.[155] Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. At this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.[108]\\n\\nLarva of the common frog Rana temporaria a day before metamorphosis\\nLarva of the common frog Rana temporaria a day before metamorphosis\\n\\n \\nMetamorphosis stage with deforming jaws, large eyes, and remains of gill pouch\\nMetamorphosis stage with deforming jaws, large eyes, and remains of gill pouch\\n\\n \\nYoung frog with a stumpy tail, metamorphosis nearly complete\\nYoung frog with a stumpy tail, metamorphosis nearly complete\\n\\nAdults\\n0:05\\nA Xenopus laevis froglet after metamorphosis.\\nAdult frogs may live in or near water, but few are fully aquatic.[156] Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including insects, crabs, spiders, mites, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals and reptiles, and fish.[157][158] A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, floral structures and nectar.[159][160] Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants,[161][162] and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume.[163] Many frogs use their sticky tongues to catch prey, while others simply grab them with their mouths.[164] Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.[165]\\n\\n\\nA trophic pyramid showing frogs as primary predators.\\nFrogs are primary predators and an important part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.[166]\\n\\nLittle is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage.[167] Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years.[168] Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).[169]\\n\\nParental care\\n\\nMale common midwife toad with eggs\\n(Alytes obstetricans).\\n\\nPouched frog (Assa darlingtoni)\\nAlthough care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs, up to an estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way.[170] The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed. Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour.[171] Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival.[172] The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.[171]\\n\\nIn small pools, predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. Certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata (water-filled leaf axils or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles.[173] While these smaller rearing sites are free from competition, they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance. Frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs.[171] The female strawberry poison-dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) lays her eggs on the forest floor. The male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist. When they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding bromeliad or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location. She visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the phytotelma, continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis.[174] The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way.[175]\\n\\nMany other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs. The tiny male Colostethus subpunctatus stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool.[176] The male common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles.[177] The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties.[178] Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.[179]\\n\\nSome frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies. Both male and female pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs.[180] The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth.[181] The female Darwin\\'s frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male\\'s mouth and emerge.[182]\\n\\nDefence\\n\\nThe mildly toxic Ranitomeya imitator.\\n\\nStrawberry poison-dart frog contains numerous alkaloids which deter predators.\\nAt first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of defensive structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.[127]\\n\\nThe skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called bufotoxins to make them unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future.[183] Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators.[184] Other species, such as the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), have their warning colour underneath. They \"flash\" this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.[4]\\n\\n\\nA common toad adopting a defensive stance.\\nSome frogs, such as the poison dart frogs, are especially toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting,[185] although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection.[186][187] Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat.[188] Others, such as the Australian corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves.[189] The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.[190]\\n\\nSome frogs use bluff or deception. The European common toad (Bufo bufo) adopts a characteristic stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered.[191] The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened. This places the parotoid glands in the most effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected.[127] Another tactic used by some frogs is to \"scream\", the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. The gray tree frog (Hyla versicolor) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew Blarina brevicauda.[127] Although toads are avoided by many predators, the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) regularly feeds on them. The strategy employed by juvenile American toads (Bufo americanus) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. This is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. If it is encountered by the snake\\'s head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.[192]\\n\\nDistribution\\n\\nAlthough frogs are most diverse in warm regions, a few species like the wood frog even live at the Arctic Circle\\nFrogs live on all the continents except Antarctica, but they are not present on certain islands, especially those far away from continental land masses.[193][194] Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers.[195] Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe.[196] Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up.[197] Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.[51]\\n\\nConservation\\nSee also: Decline in amphibian populations\\n\\nGolden toad (Bufo periglenes) – last seen in 1989.\\nIn 2006, of 4,035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status.[198] Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s.[199] Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size.[200] Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors.[201] A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss.[202] Emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.[203][204]\\n\\nMany environmental scientists believe amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults).[205] It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.[206]\\n\\n\\nDeformed mink frog with an extra left leg\\nFrog mutations and genetic defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes have been identified or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode\\'s complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.[207][208]\\n\\nIn a few cases, captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful.[209][210] The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums named 2008 as the \"Year of the Frog\" in order to draw attention to the conservation issues faced by them.[211]\\n\\nThe cane toad (Bufo marinus) is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a biological pest control agent.[212] In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to control cane beetles such as Dermolepida albohirtum, the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results in many of these countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. In many of these countries, they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.[213]\\n\\nHuman uses\\nCulinary\\nMain article: Frog legs\\n\\nFrench cuisses de grenouille.\\nFrog legs are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. Indonesia is the world\\'s largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.[214] Originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply. This resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China.[215] The annual global trade in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.[216]\\n\\nThe mountain chicken frog, so-called as it tastes of chicken, is now endangered, in part due to human consumption, and was a major food choice of the Dominicans.[217] Coon, possum, partridges, prairie hen, and frogs were among the fare Mark Twain recorded as part of American cuisine.[218]\\n\\nScientific research\\nSee also: Animal testing on frogs\\nIn November, 1970, NASA sent two bullfrogs into space for six days during the Orbiting Frog Otolith mission to test weightlessness.\\n\\nFrogs are used for dissections in high school and university anatomy classes, often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among the biological systems. This practice is declining due to animal welfare concerns, and \"digital frogs\" are now available for virtual dissection.[219]\\n\\nFrogs have served as experimental animals throughout the history of science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. He created one of the first tools for measuring electric current out of a frog leg.[220] In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog\\'s heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates.[221] The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy.[222] In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.[223]\\n\\nFrogs are used in cloning research and other branches of embryology. Although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed, biologists continue to use Xenopus as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory.[224] Xenopus laevis is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative, Xenopus tropicalis, which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the one to two years for X. laevis,[225] thus facilitating faster studies across generations.\\n\\nGenomes of Xenopus laevis, X. tropicalis, Rana catesbeiana, Rhinella marina, and Nanorana parkeri have been sequenced and deposited in the NCBI Genome database.[226]\\n\\nAs pets\\nSee also: Frogs in captivity\\nDue to being inexpensive and relatively easy to care for, many species of frogs and toads have become popular as exotic pets. They are undemanding and require low maintenance. Both frogs and toads can be housed in paludariums, terrariums and aquariums.\\n\\nPharmaceutical\\n\\nGolden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis).\\nBecause frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a \"natural pharmacy\". The alkaloid epibatidine, a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine, is made by some species of poison dart frogs. Other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to HIV infection.[227] Dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs.[228]\\n\\nIt has long been suspected that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound that has been used in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked.[229] Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.[230]\\n\\nExudations from the skin of the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) are traditionally used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun. The combination of the two alkaloid toxins batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice.[231] Two other species, the Kokoe poison dart frog (Phyllobates aurotaenia) and the black-legged dart frog (Phyllobates bicolor) are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.[231]\\n\\n\\nMoche frog sculpture\\nCultural significance\\nMain article: Frogs in culture\\nFrogs have been featured in mythology, fairy tales and popular culture. In traditional Chinese myths, the world rests on a giant frog, who would try to swallow the moon, causing the lunar eclipse. Frogs have been featured in religion, folklore, and popular culture. The ancient Egyptians depicted the god Heqet, protector of newborns, with the head of a frog. For the Mayans, frogs represented water, crops, fertility and birth and were associated with the god Chaac. In the Bible, Moses unleashes a plague of frogs on the Egyptians. Medieval Europeans associated frogs and toads with evil and witchcraft.[232] The Brothers Grimm fairy tale The Frog Prince features a princess taking in a frog and it turning into a handsome prince.[233] In modern culture, frogs may take a comedic or hapless role, such as Mr. Toad of the 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows, Michigan J. Frog of Warner Bros. Cartoons, the Muppet Kermit the Frog and in the game Frogger.[234]',\n",
              " 'The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.\\n\\nHorses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.\\n\\nHorse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"warmbloods\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.\\n\\nHorses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.\\n\\nBiology\\nMain article: Equine anatomy\\nDiagram of a horse with some parts labeled.\\nPoints of a horse[5][6]\\nSpecific terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, and colors and breeds.\\n\\nLifespan and life stages\\nDepending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7] Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[8] The oldest verifiable record was \"Old Billy\", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[7] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world\\'s oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.[9]\\n\\nRegardless of a horse or pony\\'s actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere[7][10] and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere.[11] The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal\\'s actual calendar age.[12]\\n\\nThe following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:\\n\\nFoal\\nA horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling, and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling.[13] Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.[14]\\nYearling\\nA horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.[15]\\nColt\\nA male horse under the age of four.[16] A common terminology error is to call any young horse a \"colt\", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.[17]\\nFilly\\nA female horse under the age of four.[13]\\nMare\\nA female horse four years old and older.[18]\\nStallion\\nA non-castrated male horse four years old and older.[19] The term \"horse\" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.[20]\\nGelding\\nA castrated male horse of any age.[13]\\nIn horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.[21] However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.[22]\\n\\nSize and measurement\\nThe height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back.[23] This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.\\n\\nA large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.\\nSize varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and small pony.\\nIn English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches (101.6 mm). The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation \"h\" or \"hh\" (for \"hands high\"). Thus, a horse described as \"15.2 h\" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in height.[24]\\n\\nThe size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. Light-riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64 inches, 142 to 163 cm) and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms (840 to 1,210 lb).[25] Larger-riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands (62 inches, 157 cm) and often are as tall as 17 hands (68 inches, 173 cm), weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms (1,100 to 1,320 lb).[26] Heavy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high and can be as tall as 18 hands (72 inches, 183 cm) high. They can weigh from about 700 to 1,000 kilograms (1,540 to 2,200 lb).[27]\\n\\nThe largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848. He stood 21.2 1⁄4 hands (86.25 inches, 219 cm) high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms (3,360 lb).[28] The record holder for the smallest horse ever is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. She was 43 cm (17 in) tall and weighed 26 kg (57 lb).[29][30]\\n\\nPonies\\nMain article: Pony\\nPonies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.\\n\\nThe traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm). An animal 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) a pony,[31] but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm).[32] For competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is 14.1 hands (57 inches, 145 cm).[33] The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than 148 centimetres (58.27 in) at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm), and 149 centimetres (58.66 in; 14.2+1⁄2 hands), with shoes.[34]\\n\\nHeight is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.[35] Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm), but are still considered to be ponies.[36]\\n\\nPonies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.[31] Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages 10 hands (40 inches, 102 cm), is considered a pony.[31] Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than 76 centimetres (30 in), are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.[37]\\n\\nGenetics\\nHorses have 64 chromosomes.[38] The horse genome was sequenced in 2007. It contains 2.7 billion DNA base pairs,[39] which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome.[40] The map is available to researchers.[41]\\n\\nColors and markings\\nTwo horses in a field. The one on the left is a dark brown with a black mane and tail. The one on the right is a light red all over.\\nBay (left) and chestnut (sometimes called \"sorrel\") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.\\nMain articles: Equine coat color, Equine coat color genetics, and Horse markings\\nHorses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.[42] Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,[43] which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.[44]\\n\\nMany genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color,[45] and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor,[46] also known as the \"extension gene\" or \"red factor,\"[45] as its recessive form is \"red\" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.[47] Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.[45]\\n\\nHorses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks \"white\" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.[47] Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene.[48] However, there are no \"albino\" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.[49]\\n\\nReproduction and development\\nMain article: Horse breeding\\n\\nMare with a foal\\nGestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days,[50][51] and usually results in one foal; twins are rare.[52] Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.[53] Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.[54] Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.[55]\\n\\nHorses, particularly colts, are sometimes physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.[56] Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse\\'s size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.[57]\\n\\nDepending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four.[58] Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries,[59] horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.[60] For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.[12]\\n\\nAnatomy\\nMain articles: Equine anatomy, Muscular system of the horse, Respiratory system of the horse, and Circulatory system of the horse\\nSkeletal system\\nMain article: Skeletal system of the horse\\nDiagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.\\nThe skeletal system of a modern horse\\nThe horse skeleton averages 205 bones.[61] A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse\\'s forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse\\'s four legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse\\'s \"knee\" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the \"ankle\") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the \"knuckles\" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.[62]\\n\\nHooves\\nMain articles: Horse hoof, Horseshoe, and Farrier\\nThe critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, \"no foot, no horse\".[63] The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail.[64] The result is that a horse, weighing on average 500 kilograms (1,100 lb),[65] travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.[66] For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,[67] though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.\\n\\nTeeth\\nMain article: Horse teeth\\nHorses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called \"tushes\". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as \"wolf\" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or \"bars\" of the horse\\'s mouth when the horse is bridled.[68]\\n\\nAn estimate of a horse\\'s age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse\\'s age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.[7]\\n\\nDigestion\\nMain articles: Equine digestive system and Equine nutrition\\nHorses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A 450-kilogram (990 lb) horse will eat 7 to 11 kilograms (15 to 24 lb) of food per day and, under normal use, drink 38 to 45 litres (8.4 to 9.9 imp gal; 10 to 12 US gal) of water. Horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can digest cellulose, a major component of grass. Horses are hindgut fermenters. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum, or \"water gut\", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.[69] Horses do not have a gallbladder; however, they seem to tolerate high amounts of fat in their diet despite lack of a gallbladder.[70][71]\\n\\nSenses\\nClose up of a horse eye, which is dark brown with lashes on the top eyelid\\nA horse\\'s eye\\nSee also: Equine vision\\nThe horses\\' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.[72] They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,[73] and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.[74] This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision.[73] Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.[75]\\n\\nTheir sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson\\'s organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.[76]\\n\\nA horse\\'s hearing is good,[72] and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.[77] Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels.[78] An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.[79]\\n\\nHorses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.[80] A horse\\'s sense of touch is well-developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose.[81] Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.[82]\\n\\nHorses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat,[83] and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.[84]\\n\\nMovement\\nMain articles: Horse gait, Trot, Canter, and Ambling\\nWalk 5–8 km/h (3.1–5.0 mph)\\nWalk 5–8 km/h (3.1–5.0 mph)\\n\\n \\nTrot 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph)\\nTrot 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph)\\n\\n \\nPace 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph)\\nPace 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph)\\n\\n \\nCanter 16–27 km/h (9.9–16.8 mph)\\nCanter 16–27 km/h (9.9–16.8 mph)\\n\\n \\nGallop 40–48 km/h (25–30 mph), record: 70.76 km/h (43.97 mph)\\nGallop 40–48 km/h (25–30 mph), record: 70.76 km/h (43.97 mph)\\n\\nAll horses move naturally with four basic gaits:[85]\\n\\nthe four-beat walk, which averages 6.4 kilometres per hour (4.0 mph);\\nthe two-beat trot or jog at 13 to 19 kilometres per hour (8.1 to 11.8 mph) (faster for harness racing horses);\\nthe canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is 19 to 24 kilometres per hour (12 to 15 mph);\\nthe gallop, which averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph),[86] but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 70.76 kilometres per hour (43.97 mph).[87]\\nBesides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.[88] There also are several four-beat \\'ambling\\' gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot.[89] Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses.[90] These horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.[91]\\n\\nBehavior\\nMain articles: Horse behavior and Stable vices\\n0:03\\nHorse neigh\\nHorses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first reaction to a threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.[92] They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.[93]\\n\\n\\nHorses fighting as part of herd dominance behaviour\\nHorses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.[94] However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, \"weaving\" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.[95]\\n\\nIntelligence and learning\\nStudies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. They also have good spatial discrimination abilities.[96] They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before.[97] Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement.[96] One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between \"more or less\" if the quantity involved is less than four.[98]\\n\\nDomesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural.[96] Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that \"intelligent\" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal\\'s natural inclinations.[99]\\n\\nTemperament\\nMain articles: Draft horse, Warmblood, and Oriental horse\\nMain article: Hot-blooded horse\\nHorses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. For example, the \"hot-bloods\", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy,[100] while the \"cold-bloods\", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer.[101] Sometimes \"hot-bloods\" are classified as \"light horses\" or \"riding horses\",[102] with the \"cold-bloods\" classified as \"draft horses\" or \"work horses\".[103]\\n\\na sepia-toned engraving from an old book, showing 11 horses of different breeds and sizes in nine different illustrations\\nIllustration of assorted breeds; slim, light hotbloods, medium-sized warmbloods and draft and pony-type coldblood breeds\\n\"Hot blooded\" breeds include \"oriental horses\" such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb, and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.[100] Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed.[104] They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.[105] The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.[106][107]\\n\\nMuscular, heavy draft horses are known as \"cold bloods\", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.[101] They are sometimes nicknamed \"gentle giants\".[108] Well-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale.[108] Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.[109] Others, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.[110] The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.[111]\\n\\n\"Warmblood\" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.[112] Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.[113] Warmbloods are considered a \"light horse\" or \"riding horse\".[102]\\n\\nToday, the term \"Warmblood\" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping.[114] Strictly speaking, the term \"warm blood\" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.[115] Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.[104]\\n\\nSleep patterns\\nSee also: Horse sleep patterns and Sleep in non-humans\\nTwo horses in a pasture, one is standing beside the other that is laying down.\\nWhen horses lie down to sleep, others in the herd remain standing, awake, or in a light doze, keeping watch.\\nHorses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a \"stay apparatus\" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.[116] Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.[117]\\n\\nUnlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,[117] mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each.[118] The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.[119]\\n\\nHorses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.[117] However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.[120] This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.[121]\\n\\nTaxonomy and evolution\\n\\nDiagram of evolution in horses showing size development, biometrical changes in the cranium and reduction of toes (left forefoot)\\nMain articles: Evolution of the horse, Equus (genus), and Equidae\\nThe horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not.[122] Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.[123]\\n\\nThe earliest known member of the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot.[124] The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago.[125] Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee,[126] known informally as splint bones.[127] Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed.[126] By about 5 million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved.[128] Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.\\n\\nBy about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species. Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America.[129] Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America.[130][131][132] The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival.[133] Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.[134]\\n\\nWild species surviving into modern times\\nThree tan-colored horses with upright manes. Two horses nip and paw at each other, while the third moves towards the camera. They stand in an open, rocky grassland, with forests in the distance.\\nA small herd of Przewalski\\'s Horses\\nMain article: Wild horse\\nA truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever successfully domesticated. Therefore, most \"wild\" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.[135] Only two wild subspecies, the tarpan and the Przewalski\\'s horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.\\n\\nThe Przewalski\\'s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people call it a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild by the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.[136] Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.[137][138] There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.\\n\\nThe question of whether the Przewalski\\'s horse was ever domesticated was challenged in 2018 when DNA studies of horses found at Botai culture sites revealed captured animals with DNA markers of an ancestor to the Przewalski\\'s horse. The study concluded that the Botai animals appear to have been an independent domestication attempt and apparently unsuccessful, as these genetic markers do not appear in modern domesticated horses. However, the question of whether all Przewalski\\'s horses descend from this population is also unresolved, as only one of seven modern Przewalski’s horses in the study shared this ancestry.[139][140][141]\\n\\nThe tarpan or European wild horse (Equus ferus ferus) was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo.[142] Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan,[142][143][144] which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.\\n\\nPeriodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such,[138] but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses.[145] Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan on the basis of shared characteristics,[146][147] but genetic studies have shown that the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds, and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.[146][148]\\n\\nOther modern equids\\nMain article: Equus (genus)\\nBesides the horse, there are six other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the mountain zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy\\'s Zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.[149]\\n\\nHorses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a \"jack\" (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a \"jenny\" (female donkey).[150] Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse.[151] With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.[152]\\n\\nDomestication and history\\nMain articles: History of horse domestication theories and Domestication of the horse\\n\\nBhimbetka rock painting showing a man riding on a horse, India\\nDomestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BCE. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.\\n\\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000–3500 BCE.[153][154][155] By 3000 BCE, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.[156] The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BCE.[157]\\n\\nA 2021 genetic study suggested that most modern domestic horses descend from the lower Volga-Don region. Ancient horse genomes indicate that these populations influenced almost all local populations as they expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, beginning about 4,200 years ago. It also shows that certain adaptations were strongly selected due to riding, and that equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots spread with the horse itself.[158][159]\\n\\nDomestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse,[160][161] while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.[148][162][163] This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability,[160][161] but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA.[148][162][163] There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds.[148][162][163][164] Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation.[165] In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BCE.[166]\\n\\nBefore the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.[111] Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication.[167] However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.\\n\\nFeral populations\\nMain article: Feral horse\\nFeral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals.[135] Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world.[168][169] Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses,[170] as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.[171]\\n\\nThere are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in \"wild\" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.[172][173]\\n\\nBreeds\\nMain articles: Horse breed, List of horse breeds, and Horse breeding\\nThe concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called \"thoroughbreds\". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a \"purebred\" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry.[174] Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.[175] These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.[176] In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.[177]\\n\\nBreeds developed due to a need for \"form to function\", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.[178] Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.[178] Heavy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons.[179] Other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.[180] Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed.[181] There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.[182]\\n\\nInteraction with humans\\n\\nFinnhorse pulling a heavy wagon.\\nWorldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.[183] The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.[184] In a 2004 \"poll\" conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world\\'s 4th favorite animal.[185]\\n\\nCommunication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;[186] to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.[187] Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,[188] and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.[189] Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.[190]\\n\\nSport\\nA chestnut (reddish-brown) horse being ridden by a rider in a black coat and top hat. They are stopped in a riding arena with the rider tipping his hat.\\nA horse and rider in dressage competition at the Olympics\\nMain articles: Equestrianism, Horse racing, Horse training, and Horse tack\\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing, and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.[186] Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.[186]\\n\\nHorses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting.[191] Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as \"In-hand\" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.[192] Sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider\\'s actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.[193] Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,[194] and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.[193]\\n\\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky.[195] A major part of horse racing\\'s economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.[196]\\n\\nWork\\nTired-looking bay horse hitched to a rustic cart\\nHorse pulling a cart\\nA mounted man in a blue uniform on a dark brown horse\\nA mounted police officer in Poland\\nThere are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.[197] Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.[198] Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.[199] Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.[200]\\n\\nAlthough machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27 million working animals in Africa alone.[201] Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses.[202][203] Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.[204]\\n\\nWarfare\\nMain article: Horses in warfare\\nBlack-and-white photo of mounted soldiers with middle eastern headwraps, carrying rifles, walking down a road away from the camera\\nOttoman cavalry, 1917\\nHorses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BCE,[205] and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age.[206][207] Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.[208]\\n\\nEntertainment and culture\\n\\nThe horse-headed deity in Hinduism, Hayagriva\\nSee also: Horses in art and Horse worship\\nModern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.[209] Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events.[210] Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.[211]\\n\\nHorses are frequently used in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories.[212] Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products.[213] The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment.[214] The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Germanic, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun.[215] The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.[216]\\n\\nHorses serve as the inspiration for many modern automobile names and logos, including the Ford Pinto, Ford Bronco, Ford Mustang, Hyundai Equus, Hyundai Pony, Mitsubishi Starion, Subaru Brumby, Mitsubishi Colt/Dodge Colt, Volkswagen Polo, Pinzgauer, Steyr-Puch Haflinger, Pegaso, Porsche, Rolls-Royce Camargue, Ferrari, Carlsson, Kamaz, Corre La Licorne, Iran Khodro, Eicher, and Baojun.[217][218][219] Indian TVS Motor Company also uses a horse on their motorcycles & scooters.\\n\\nTherapeutic use\\nSee also: Equine-assisted therapy and Therapeutic horseback riding\\nPeople of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from an association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.[220] The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI).[221] Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that use equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse\\'s movement to improve their patient\\'s cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.[222]\\n\\nHorses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. \"Equine-assisted\" or \"equine-facilitated\" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.[223] There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.[224]\\n\\nProducts\\nHorses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.\\n\\nProducts collected from living horses include mare\\'s milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis.[225] Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses\\' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat.[225] The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares\\' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy.[226] The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.[227]\\n\\nHorse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. Approximately 5 million horses are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[228] It is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures,[229] and a subject of political controversy in others.[230] Horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets,[231] baseballs,[232] and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue.[233] Horse bones can be used to make implements.[234] Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures.[235] In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.[236]\\n\\nCare\\nMain article: Horse care\\nSee also: Equine nutrition, Horse grooming, Veterinary medicine, and Farrier\\nA young man in US military clothing examines the teeth of a bay (dark brown) horse, while another person in military work clothing, partially obscured, holds the horse. Several other people are partially visible in the background.\\nChecking teeth and other physical examinations are an important part of horse care.\\nHorses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture.[237] They can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a 450-kilogram (990 lb) adult horse could eat up to 11 kilograms (24 lb) of food.[238] Sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active.[239] When grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal\\'s diet by weight should still be forage.[240]\\n\\nHorses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of 38 to 45 litres (10 to 12 US gal) per day.[241] Although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.[242]\\n\\nHorses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist.[243] If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being.[244] When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained.[245] Regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.[246]']"
